# Compilation Issues Summary

The interface exception service has multiple compilation issues:

## Main Issues:
1. **Lombok not generating getters/setters** - Annotation processor may not be running correctly
2. **Dynatrace SDK missing** - Classes are conditional but still causing compilation errors
3. **Spring Boot actuator packages missing** - Some packages don't exist in current version
4. **Redis serialization packages missing** - Package structure may have changed

## Quick Fix Strategy:
1. Temporarily disable Dynatrace components by renaming them
2. Fix the most critical Lombok issues
3. Comment out problematic imports and methods
4. Get basic compilation working first

## Files with Issues:
- All Dynatrace related files (conditional but still compiling)
- RetryService (missing getters/setters)
- GraphQL config files (missing packages)
- Entity relationship methods (Lombok not generating)

## Recommendation:
Focus on getting the core service to compile by temporarily disabling advanced features, then gradually re-enable them once the basic structure works.
