- ✅ RSocket connection availability checking

#### Success Scenarios
- ✅ Successful order data retrieval with complete order structure
- ✅ Different order ID pattern handling (TEST-ORDER-1, TEST-ORD-2025-018, etc.)
- ✅ Metrics and logging verification for successful calls
- ✅ Proper response structure validation

#### Failure Scenarios
- ✅ RSocket connection errors handling
- ✅ Null RSocket requester handling
- ✅ Order not found scenarios
- ✅ Error metrics and logging verification

#### Timeout and Circuit Breaker Behavior
- ✅ Timeout scenario handling with proper metrics recording
- ✅ Circuit breaker open state fallback responses
- ✅ Various circuit breaker exception types handling
- ✅ Circuit breaker metrics recording

#### Mock Server Unavailable Scenarios
- ✅ Complete server unavailability handling
- ✅ Reconnection attempts when requester is null
- ✅ Proper error response generation

### 2. ExceptionProcessingService Tests
Enhanced `ExceptionProcessingServiceTest.java` with additional order data retrieval tests:

#### Order Data Retrieval Tests
- ✅ Successful order data retrieval and storage
- ✅ Order data retrieval failure handling
- ✅ Missing source service client handling
- ✅ Timeout during order data retrieval
- ✅ Circuit breaker open during order data retrieval
- ✅ Partial order data retrieval handling
- ✅ Retry order data retrieval for existing exceptions

## Key Test Features
