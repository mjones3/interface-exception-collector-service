 * GraphQL Security configuration - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * This configuration has been integrated into the main SecurityConfig.java

 * 
 * All GraphQL security configuration including:
 * - JWT authentication for GraphQL endpoints
 * - Role-based authorization
 * - CORS configuration for GraphQL
 * - Security headers
 * 
 * Is now handled by the main SecurityConfig.java file.
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference but is no longer active.
