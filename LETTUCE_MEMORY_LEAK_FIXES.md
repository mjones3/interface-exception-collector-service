# Lettuce Redis Memory Leak Fixes

## Problem
The application was showing memory leak warnings during shutdown:
```
The web application [ROOT] appears to have started a thread named [lettuce-eventExecutorLoop-1-1] but has failed to stop it.
The web application [ROOT] appears to have started a thread named [lettuce-timer-3-1] but has failed to stop it.
```

## Root Cause
Lettuce Redis client creates background threads for:
- Event executor loops (for async operations)
- Timer threads (for connection timeouts and retries)

These threads were not being properly shut down when the application stopped, causing memory leak warnings.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Redis Configuration (`application.yml`)
```yaml
spring:
  # Lifecycle management for proper shutdown
  lifecycle:
    timeout-per-shutdown-phase: 30s
  
  data:
    redis:
      lettuce:
        # Enhanced shutdown configuration to prevent memory leaks
        shutdown-timeout: 2000ms
        shutdown-quiet-period: 100ms

server:
  # Graceful shutdown configuration to prevent memory leaks
  shutdown: graceful
```

### 2. Redis Shutdown Configuration Class
Created `RedisShutdownConfig.java` with:
- `@PreDestroy` method to ensure proper cleanup
- Proper timing for Lettuce connection factory shutdown
- Garbage collection to help with resource cleanup

### 3. Lettuce Shutdown Hook
Created `LettuceShutdownHook.java` with:
- Application context event listener for shutdown
- Thread monitoring to track Lettuce threads
- Coordinated cleanup process

## How It Works

1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Spring Boot initiates graceful shutdown
2. **Event Listener**: `LettuceShutdownHook` responds to context closing
3. **Connection Cleanup**: `RedisShutdownConfig` destroys Lettuce connections
4. **Thread Monitoring**: System monitors for remaining Lettuce threads
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Garbage collection helps clean up references

## Key Configuration Changes

### Application Properties
- Added `server.shutdown: graceful`
- Added `spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase: 30s`
- Enhanced Redis Lettuce shutdown settings

### Java Configuration
- `RedisShutdownConfig`: Handles connection factory cleanup
- `LettuceShutdownHook`: Monitors and coordinates shutdown process

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:
- ✅ No more memory leak warnings for `lettuce-eventExecutorLoop` threads
- ✅ No more memory leak warnings for `lettuce-timer` threads
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup during application shutdown
- ✅ Faster and cleaner application termination

## Benefits

1. **Memory Management**: Prevents memory leaks in containerized environments
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensures all Redis connections are properly closed
3. **Performance**: Faster application shutdown without hanging threads
4. **Monitoring**: Better visibility into thread cleanup process
5. **Production Ready**: Suitable for production deployments with proper resource management

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:
1. Start the application
2. Perform Redis operations (caching, etc.)
3. Stop the application gracefully
4. Check logs - should not see memory leak warnings
5. Monitor thread count during shutdown

The fixes ensure proper resource management and eliminate the Lettuce memory leak warnings while maintaining application functionality.
