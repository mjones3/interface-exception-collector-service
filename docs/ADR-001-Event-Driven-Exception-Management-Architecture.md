# ADR-001: Event-Driven Exception Management Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-08-21

## Context

The BioPro platform consists of multiple interface services (Order, Collection, Distribution, Recruitment) that process critical healthcare operations. Each service can encounter various types of exceptions during processing, including business rule violations, validation errors, external service failures, and system errors.

### Current Challenges

1. **Distributed Exception Handling**: Each interface service handles exceptions independently, leading to:
   - Inconsistent exception handling patterns
   - Lack of centralized visibility into system health
   - Difficulty in correlating related exceptions across services
   - Manual intervention required for exception resolution

2. **Operational Visibility**: Operations teams lack:
   - Real-time visibility into exception patterns
   - Centralized dashboard for monitoring system health
   - Automated alerting for critical exceptions
   - Historical analysis capabilities for trend identification

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Current system limitations:
   - No standardized retry mechanisms across services
   - Manual intervention required for most exception recovery
   - Lack of audit trail for exception resolution activities
   - No correlation between exceptions and business impact

4. **Scalability Concerns**: As the platform grows:
   - Exception volume will increase significantly
   - Need for horizontal scaling of exception processing
   - Requirements for high availability and fault tolerance
   - Integration with additional interface services

### Business Requirements

- **Centralized Exception Management**: Single point of control for all interface exceptions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboards for operations teams
- **Automated Recovery**: Intelligent retry mechanisms with minimal manual intervention
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Complete lifecycle tracking of exceptions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for growing exception volumes and new services
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime requirement for exception processing

## Decision

We will implement an **Event-Driven Exception Management Architecture** using Apache Kafka as the central event streaming platform for the Interface Exception Collector Service.

### Core Architectural Components

#### 1. Event-Driven Communication Pattern

**Implementation**:
- All interface services publish exception events to dedicated Kafka topics
- Exception Collector Service consumes events asynchronously
- Downstream systems receive notifications through published events
- Event sourcing pattern for complete audit trail

**Event Topics**:
```yaml
Inbound Topics:
  - OrderRejected: Order processing failures
  - OrderCancelled: Order cancellation events
  - CollectionRejected: Collection workflow failures
  - DistributionFailed: Distribution process errors
  - ValidationError: Schema and business rule violations

Outbound Topics:
  - ExceptionCaptured: New exception notifications
  - ExceptionResolved: Resolution notifications
  - ExceptionRetryCompleted: Retry operation results
  - CriticalExceptionAlert: High-priority alerts
```

#### 2. Asynchronous Processing Architecture

**Event Processing Flow**:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IS as Interface Service
    participant KT as Kafka Topic
    participant EC as Exception Collector
    participant DB as Database
    participant AT as Alert Topic
    participant DT as Dashboard Topic
    
    IS->>KT: Publish Exception Event
    KT->>EC: Consume Event (async)
    EC->>EC: Process & Categorize
    EC->>DB: Store Exception
    EC->>AT: Publish Alert (if critical)
    EC->>DT: Publish Dashboard Update
    Note over EC: All processing is non-blocking
```

#### 3. Consumer Group Strategy

**Parallel Processing Design**:
```yaml
Consumer Groups:
  exception-collector-main:
    topics: [OrderRejected, CollectionRejected, DistributionFailed, ValidationError]
    partitions: 3 per topic
    instances: 3
    processing: parallel
    max_poll_records: 100
    
  exception-collector-alerts:
    topics: [CriticalExceptionAlert]
    partitions: 1
    instances: 2
    processing: sequential (for alert ordering)
    
  exception-collector-retry:
    topics: [ExceptionRetryRequested]
    partitions: 2
    instances: 2
    processing: parallel
```

#### 4. Event Schema Design

**Standardized Event Structure**:
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "OrderRejected",
  "eventVersion": "1.0",
  "occurredOn": "2025-08-21T10:30:00Z",
  "source": "order-service",
  "correlationId": "uuid",
  "causationId": "uuid",
  "payload": {
    "transactionId": "uuid",
    "externalId": "ORDER-ABC123",
    "operation": "CREATE_ORDER",
    "rejectedReason": "Order already exists",
    "customerId": "CUST001",
    "locationCode": "LOC001",
    "metadata": {
      "retryable": true,
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "category": "BUSINESS_RULE"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Fault Tolerance and Resilience

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed messages routed to DLQ for manual review
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protection against cascading failures
- **Idempotent Processing**: Safe message reprocessing using transaction IDs

**Resilience Patterns**:
```yaml
Retry Configuration:
  max_attempts: 3
  backoff_strategy: exponential
  initial_delay: 1s
  max_delay: 30s
  
Circuit Breaker:
  failure_threshold: 5
  timeout: 30s
  half_open_max_calls: 3
  
Dead Letter Queue:
  enabled: true
  max_delivery_attempts: 3
  retention: 7 days
```

## Rationale

### Why Event-Driven Architecture?

#### 1. **Loose Coupling**
- **Problem**: Direct service-to-service calls create tight coupling
- **Solution**: Event-driven communication eliminates direct dependencies
- **Benefit**: Services can evolve independently without breaking integrations

#### 2. **Scalability**
- **Problem**: Synchronous processing creates bottlenecks
- **Solution**: Asynchronous event processing enables independent scaling
- **Benefit**: Each component can scale based on its specific load patterns

#### 3. **Resilience**
- **Problem**: Service failures cascade through synchronous calls
- **Solution**: Event persistence ensures no data loss during failures
- **Benefit**: System continues operating even when individual components fail

#### 4. **Auditability**
- **Problem**: Lack of complete audit trail for exception lifecycle
- **Solution**: Event sourcing provides immutable event history
- **Benefit**: Complete traceability and ability to replay events for debugging

#### 5. **Real-time Capabilities**
- **Problem**: Batch processing delays critical exception notifications
- **Solution**: Stream processing enables real-time event handling
- **Benefit**: Immediate alerts and dashboard updates for critical exceptions

### Why Apache Kafka?

#### 1. **High Throughput and Low Latency**
- Handles millions of events per second
- Sub-millisecond latency for event delivery
