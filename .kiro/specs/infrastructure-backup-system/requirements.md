# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities to the existing BioPro exception collector infrastructure. The system will provide automated backup mechanisms for PostgreSQL databases, Kafka topics, and configuration data, along with restoration capabilities to ensure business continuity and data protection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated database backups, so that I can recover from data loss incidents without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs daily at 2 AM THEN the system SHALL create a full PostgreSQL backup
2. WHEN a backup is created THEN the system SHALL compress and timestamp the backup file
3. WHEN backup storage exceeds 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically delete older backups
4. IF a backup fails THEN the system SHALL send an alert notification
5. WHEN a backup completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log the backup size and duration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to backup Kafka topic data and configurations, so that I can restore message queues and their settings after system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Kafka backup is initiated THEN the system SHALL export all topic configurations
2. WHEN backing up Kafka THEN the system SHALL capture consumer group offsets
3. WHEN a Kafka backup runs THEN the system SHALL store topic metadata and partition information
4. IF Kafka is unavailable during backup THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. WHEN Kafka backup completes THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want point-in-time recovery capabilities, so that I can restore the system to a specific state before an incident occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a restore operation THEN the system SHALL list available backup timestamps
2. WHEN a restore point is selected THEN the system SHALL stop all running services safely
3. WHEN restoring database THEN the system SHALL validate backup integrity before proceeding
4. WHEN restoring Kafka THEN the system SHALL recreate topics with original configurations
5. WHEN restore completes THEN the system SHALL restart all services in correct dependency order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want backup monitoring and alerting, so that I can be notified of backup failures or issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backup fails THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to configured recipients
2. WHEN backup storage is 80% full THEN the system SHALL send a warning alert
3. WHEN backup has not run for 25 hours THEN the system SHALL send a missed backup alert
4. WHEN backup completes THEN the system SHALL update a health status endpoint
5. IF backup takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL send a performance warning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to test backup integrity regularly, so that I can ensure backups are valid and restorable when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weekly integrity check runs THEN the system SHALL restore a random backup to a test environment
2. WHEN integrity check completes THEN the system SHALL verify data consistency
3. WHEN integrity test fails THEN the system SHALL mark the backup as corrupted and alert administrators
4. WHEN integrity check passes THEN the system SHALL log successful validation
5. IF test environment is unavailable THEN the system SHALL skip integrity check and log the skip reason

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable backup retention policies, so that I can balance storage costs with recovery requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring retention THEN the system SHALL support daily, weekly, and monthly retention periods
2. WHEN retention policy changes THEN the system SHALL apply new rules to existing backups
3. WHEN backup cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL preserve at least one backup per retention category
4. IF storage space is critically low THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping the most recent backups
5. WHEN backups are deleted THEN the system SHALL log which backups were removed and why

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backup and restore operations to be scriptable, so that I can integrate them into CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup script is executed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes for success/failure
2. WHEN restore script runs THEN the system SHALL accept backup timestamp as a parameter
3. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options
4. IF script parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. WHEN automation calls backup APIs THEN the system SHALL authenticate requests and log access
