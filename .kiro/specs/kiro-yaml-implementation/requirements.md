# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the complete Interface Exception Collector Service as specified in the kiro.yaml configuration file. The system will be an event-driven microservice that collects, stores, and manages exception events from BioPro interface services (Order, Collection, Distribution), providing centralized exception visibility, retry capabilities, and operational dashboards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to be upgraded to Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.2.1, so that the system uses modern, supported versions with improved performance and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL use Java 21 as the target version
2. WHEN Maven compiles the code THEN the system SHALL use Java 21 compiler source and target
3. WHEN Docker builds the image THEN the system SHALL use OpenJDK 21 base image
4. WHEN Spring Boot starts THEN the system SHALL use version 3.2.1
5. IF any Java version references exist in configuration files THEN the system SHALL update them to version 21

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies added to the project, so that the system has Kafka integration, database connectivity, and testing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Maven resolves dependencies THEN the system SHALL include Spring Kafka 3.0.12
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL have PostgreSQL driver available
3. WHEN database migrations run THEN the system SHALL use Flyway core for schema management
4. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL have Testcontainers for PostgreSQL and Kafka
5. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL include Lombok and MapStruct for code generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper application configuration, so that the system can connect to PostgreSQL and Kafka with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to PostgreSQL using configured credentials
2. WHEN Kafka consumers initialize THEN the system SHALL use the interface-exception-collector group ID
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use Hibernate with PostgreSQL dialect
4. WHEN Flyway runs THEN the system SHALL apply migrations from classpath:db/migration
5. WHEN management endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL expose health, metrics, and Prometheus endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the initial database schema created, so that the system can store interface exception data with proper indexing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migration runs THEN the system SHALL create interface_exceptions table
2. WHEN storing exceptions THEN the system SHALL enforce unique transaction_id constraint
3. WHEN querying exceptions THEN the system SHALL use indexes on transaction_id, interface_type, timestamp, and status
4. WHEN exception records are created THEN the system SHALL automatically set created_at and updated_at timestamps
5. WHEN exceptions are stored THEN the system SHALL support retryable flag and severity levels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kafka topics created automatically, so that the system can handle inbound and outbound exception events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kafka setup runs THEN the system SHALL create OrderRejected, OrderCancelled, CollectionRejected, and DistributionFailed topics
2. WHEN topics are created THEN the system SHALL configure 3 partitions for high-throughput topics
3. WHEN outbound topics are created THEN the system SHALL include ExceptionCaptured, ExceptionRetryCompleted, and ExceptionResolved
4. WHEN critical alerts are needed THEN the system SHALL have CriticalExceptionAlert topic with single partition
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL create test-specific topics with single partitions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want local development environment setup with Tilt, so that I can run the complete system with live reload capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tilt starts THEN the system SHALL deploy PostgreSQL, Kafka, Kafka UI, and the application
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically rebuild and restart the application
3. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL expose appropriate port forwards for local access
4. WHEN dependencies are ready THEN the system SHALL automatically run database migrations and create Kafka topics
5. WHEN development environment runs THEN the system SHALL provide live update synchronization for compiled classes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker Compose configuration, so that I can run the infrastructure services locally without Kubernetes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Compose starts THEN the system SHALL run PostgreSQL with persistent data volume
2. WHEN Kafka starts THEN the system SHALL use KRaft mode without Zookeeper dependency
3. WHEN Kafka UI starts THEN the system SHALL connect to the local Kafka cluster
4. WHEN services are healthy THEN the system SHALL expose ports for external access
5. WHEN containers restart THEN the system SHALL maintain data persistence through volumes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main application class configured, so that the system starts as a Spring Boot application with Kafka enabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize as InterfaceExceptionCollectorApplication
2. WHEN Spring context loads THEN the system SHALL enable Kafka annotation processing
3. WHEN the main method executes THEN the system SHALL start the Spring Boot application context
4. WHEN application is ready THEN the system SHALL be available on port 8080
5. WHEN Kafka is enabled THEN the system SHALL be ready to process Kafka messages
