# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The JWT authentication system in the interface-exception-collector service is experiencing signature validation failures. The system needs to be fixed to ensure proper JWT token validation for API endpoints, specifically resolving algorithm mismatches between token generation (Node.js) and validation (Java JJWT library).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to authenticate using JWT tokens, so that I can securely access protected endpoints like `/api/v1/exceptions`

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid JWT token is provided in the Authorization header THEN the system SHALL authenticate the request successfully
2. WHEN an invalid or expired JWT token is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
3. WHEN no JWT token is provided for protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent JWT signature algorithms between token generation and validation, so that tokens are properly validated

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are generated THEN they SHALL use the same cryptographic algorithm as the validation service
2. WHEN the JWT validation service processes tokens THEN it SHALL use the same secret key and algorithm as token generation
3. IF there is an algorithm mismatch THEN the system SHALL be configured to use a consistent algorithm (HmacSHA256)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error logging for JWT validation failures, so that I can troubleshoot authentication issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific reason for failure
2. WHEN JWT validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL log successful authentication
3. WHEN debugging JWT issues THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging information without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable JWT token generation script, so that I can create valid tokens for testing and development

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating JWT tokens THEN the script SHALL create tokens with correct expiration times
2. WHEN generating JWT tokens THEN the script SHALL use the same secret and algorithm as the validation service
3. WHEN generating JWT tokens THEN the script SHALL output tokens in the correct format for API requests
