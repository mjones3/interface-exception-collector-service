# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing GraphQL API with comprehensive retry management mutations. Building on the current retry and acknowledge operations, this adds resolve and cancel retry capabilities to provide complete lifecycle management for exception handling operations. The mutations are designed to be simple and focused, avoiding complex dependencies like Redis while maintaining the existing database-driven approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to retry failed exceptions through GraphQL mutations, so that I can reprocess failed operations without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates an exception retry THEN the system SHALL provide a `retryException` mutation that accepts transactionId and optional reason
2. WHEN a retry is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the exception exists and is in a retryable state
3. WHEN a retry is processed THEN the system SHALL increment the retry count and update the exception status to RETRYING
4. WHEN a retry mutation is executed THEN the system SHALL return success/failure status with detailed error messages
5. WHEN a retry is initiated THEN the system SHALL record the retry attempt with timestamp and initiating user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to acknowledge exceptions through GraphQL mutations, so that I can mark exceptions as reviewed without resolving them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user acknowledges an exception THEN the system SHALL provide an `acknowledgeException` mutation that accepts transactionId, reason, and optional notes
2. WHEN an acknowledgment is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the exception exists and is not already resolved
3. WHEN an acknowledgment is processed THEN the system SHALL update the exception status to ACKNOWLEDGED
4. WHEN an acknowledgment mutation is executed THEN the system SHALL record the acknowledging user and timestamp
5. WHEN an acknowledgment is completed THEN the system SHALL return the updated exception data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to resolve exceptions through GraphQL mutations, so that I can mark exceptions as permanently fixed without retrying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user resolves an exception THEN the system SHALL provide a `resolveException` mutation that accepts transactionId, resolution reason, and optional notes
2. WHEN a resolution is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the exception exists and is not already resolved
3. WHEN a resolution is processed THEN the system SHALL update the exception status to RESOLVED
4. WHEN a resolution mutation is executed THEN the system SHALL record the resolving user, timestamp, and resolution details
5. WHEN a resolution is completed THEN the system SHALL prevent further retry attempts on the exception

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to cancel ongoing retry operations through GraphQL mutations, so that I can stop retries that are no longer needed or are causing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user cancels a retry THEN the system SHALL provide a `cancelRetry` mutation that accepts transactionId and cancellation reason
2. WHEN a retry cancellation is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the exception exists and has an active retry in progress
3. WHEN a retry cancellation is processed THEN the system SHALL update the exception status from RETRYING back to FAILED
4. WHEN a retry cancellation mutation is executed THEN the system SHALL record the cancellation details and timestamp
5. WHEN a retry is cancelled THEN the system SHALL allow future retry attempts on the same exception

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all retry mutations to be secure and auditable, so that I can track who performed what operations and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any retry mutation is executed THEN the system SHALL require valid JWT authentication
2. WHEN mutations are performed THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control (OPERATIONS role minimum)
3. WHEN mutation operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all actions with user identity, timestamp, and operation details
4. WHEN mutations are executed THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and return structured error responses
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain complete history of all status changes and user actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the GraphQL API, I want consistent and well-typed mutation interfaces, so that I can build reliable client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers use retry mutations THEN the system SHALL provide strongly typed GraphQL schema definitions
2. WHEN mutation results are returned THEN the system SHALL include success status, updated exception data, and error details
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured GraphQL errors with specific field-level messages
4. WHEN mutations are documented THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions and examples in the GraphQL schema
5. WHEN client applications integrate THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing mutation signatures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want retry mutations to be performant and reliable, so that dashboard operations remain responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retry mutations are executed THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds for individual operations (95th percentile)
2. WHEN multiple mutations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without data corruption
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use optimistic locking to prevent race conditions
4. WHEN mutations are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain transactional integrity for all database updates
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain mutation performance without degrading query operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want real-time updates when retry operations complete, so that I can see the results immediately without refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retry mutations complete THEN the system SHALL publish real-time updates via existing GraphQL subscriptions
2. WHEN exception status changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all subscribed clients within 2 seconds
3. WHEN subscription filters are active THEN the system SHALL only send updates that match the client's filter criteria
4. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL efficiently broadcast updates without performance degradation
5. WHEN mutation results are published THEN the system SHALL include complete exception data in subscription updates
