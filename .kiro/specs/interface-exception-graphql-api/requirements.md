# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interface Exception GraphQL API provides a unified, type-safe interface for the BioPro Operations Dashboard to query and manipulate interface exception data. This API layer sits between the dashboard UI and the Interface Exception Collector Service, offering real-time data access, comprehensive filtering capabilities, and mutation operations for exception management.

The GraphQL API solves the challenges of traditional REST APIs by providing a single endpoint for all dashboard operations, type safety, efficient queries, real-time subscriptions, batch operations, and self-documenting capabilities through introspection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to query exception data through a GraphQL API, so that I can efficiently retrieve exactly the data I need for dashboard displays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests exception data THEN the system SHALL provide a GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql`
2. WHEN a user queries exceptions THEN the system SHALL support filtering by interface type, status, severity, date range, customer ID, location code, and search terms
3. WHEN a user requests exception lists THEN the system SHALL support cursor-based pagination for performance
4. WHEN a user queries exception details THEN the system SHALL provide complete exception context including original payloads and retry history
5. WHEN a user makes GraphQL queries THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for list queries and 1s for detail queries (95th percentile)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want real-time updates of exception data, so that I can see live changes without manually refreshing the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions are created or updated THEN the system SHALL publish real-time updates via GraphQL subscriptions
2. WHEN a user subscribes to exception updates THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming
3. WHEN subscription events occur THEN the system SHALL deliver updates with less than 2 second latency end-to-end
4. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL handle 1000+ concurrent WebSocket connections
5. WHEN subscription filters are applied THEN the system SHALL only send relevant updates based on user-specified criteria

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to perform operational actions on exceptions, so that I can retry failed operations and acknowledge exceptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates an exception retry THEN the system SHALL provide a GraphQL mutation to retry exceptions
2. WHEN a retry is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the exception exists and is retryable
3. WHEN a retry is processed THEN the system SHALL fetch the original payload and resubmit it to the appropriate service
4. WHEN a user acknowledges an exception THEN the system SHALL provide a GraphQL mutation to update the exception status
5. WHEN mutations are executed THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds (95th percentile)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a BioPro Operations Dashboard user, I want to view aggregated statistics and metrics, so that I can understand exception trends and system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests dashboard statistics THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated exception counts by interface type, status, and severity
2. WHEN a user requests trend data THEN the system SHALL provide time-series data for exception patterns
3. WHEN a user requests key metrics THEN the system SHALL provide retry success rates and customer impact statistics
4. WHEN dashboard queries are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms (95th percentile)
5. WHEN statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL use materialized views and caching for optimal performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GraphQL API to be secure and performant, so that it can handle production workloads safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the GraphQL API THEN the system SHALL require JWT authentication for all operations
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL implement query complexity analysis to prevent resource-intensive operations
3. WHEN external services are called THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns for resilience
4. WHEN data is frequently accessed THEN the system SHALL use Redis caching with appropriate TTL values
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% availability during business hours

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the GraphQL API, I want comprehensive type safety and documentation, so that I can build reliable client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers access the API THEN the system SHALL provide a strongly typed GraphQL schema
2. WHEN developers need documentation THEN the system SHALL support GraphQL introspection for self-documentation
3. WHEN developers make queries THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs against the schema
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured GraphQL errors with appropriate error codes
5. WHEN developers test the API THEN the system SHALL provide a GraphiQL interface in development environments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can ensure the GraphQL API is performing optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL operations are executed THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on query performance, error rates, and usage patterns
2. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for database and cache connectivity
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and troubleshooting
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide alerting based on response time and error rate thresholds
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments with blue-green strategy

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want efficient data loading and caching, so that the GraphQL API performs well under high load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN related data is requested THEN the system SHALL use DataLoader pattern to batch and cache database queries
2. WHEN expensive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL implement field-level caching for computed results
3. WHEN external services are called THEN the system SHALL cache responses to reduce external service load
4. WHEN cache is used THEN the system SHALL achieve greater than 80% cache hit rate for dashboard summary queries
5. WHEN N+1 query problems could occur THEN the system SHALL prevent them through proper batching strategies
