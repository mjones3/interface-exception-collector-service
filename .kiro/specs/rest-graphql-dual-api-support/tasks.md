# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses specifically on **enabling the existing GraphQL implementation** alongside the REST API. The GraphQL design and components are already well-defined in `.kiro/specs/interface-exception-graphql-api/design.md`. This plan addresses the integration aspects needed to support both APIs simultaneously with shared security and infrastructure.

**Note**: The comprehensive GraphQL implementation details (resolvers, DataLoaders, schema, etc.) are already designed in the existing GraphQL API spec. This plan focuses on the activation and dual-API integration tasks.

## Deployment Considerations

### Configuration Management
- Use feature flags to enable GraphQL gradually

- Set up monitoring and alerting for GraphQL-specific metrics
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing REST API clients

### Rollout Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Enable GraphQL in development environment
2. **Phase 2**: Deploy to staging with comprehensive testing
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual rollout to production with feature flags
4. **Phase 4**: Full production deployment with monitoring

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor GraphQL query performance and complexity
- Track subscription connection counts and health
- Alert on GraphQL error rates and performance degradation
- Monitor cache hit rates for both REST and GraphQL operations

This implementation plan ensures a systematic approach to enabling GraphQL while maintaining the existing REST API functionality and security model.
