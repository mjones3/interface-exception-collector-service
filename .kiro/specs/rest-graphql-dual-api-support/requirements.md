# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interface Exception Collector Service currently has a comprehensive GraphQL API design (documented in `.kiro/specs/interface-exception-graphql-api/`) but the GraphQL implementation is disabled (code exists in `java-disabled` directory). The service needs to **activate the existing GraphQL implementation** alongside the currently active REST API to serve different client needs simultaneously.

This dual API integration ensures backward compatibility for existing REST clients while enabling the advanced GraphQL features already designed for the BioPro Operations Dashboard. The key challenge is integrating both APIs to share the same security model, business logic, and infrastructure without conflicts.

**Note**: This spec focuses on **integration aspects only**. The comprehensive GraphQL requirements, schema design, and feature specifications are already documented in the existing GraphQL API spec.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to activate the existing GraphQL implementation alongside the current REST API, so that both APIs can coexist without conflicts or service disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL is activated THEN the system SHALL move GraphQL code from `java-disabled` to active directory without breaking existing REST functionality
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL expose both REST endpoints at `/api/v1/*` and GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` simultaneously
3. WHEN GraphQL is enabled THEN the system SHALL resolve any configuration conflicts between GraphQL and existing REST configurations
4. WHEN GraphQL components are activated THEN the system SHALL ensure all GraphQL beans are properly registered and functional
5. WHEN feature flags are used THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling GraphQL independently without affecting REST API operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the activated GraphQL API to integrate seamlessly with the existing JWT authentication and authorization system, so that security policies remain consistent and unified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL is activated THEN the system SHALL integrate GraphQL endpoints with the existing JWT authentication filter without creating duplicate security configurations
2. WHEN users access GraphQL endpoints THEN the system SHALL use the same JWT Bearer token authentication as the REST API
3. WHEN GraphQL resolvers are executed THEN the system SHALL apply the same role-based access control (ADMIN, OPERATOR, VIEWER) using existing security infrastructure
4. WHEN security context is needed THEN the system SHALL provide the same user context to GraphQL resolvers as REST controllers receive
5. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL extend existing CORS policies to include GraphQL endpoints without conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the activated GraphQL resolvers to integrate with the existing service layer, so that both APIs use identical business logic and return consistent data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL resolvers are activated THEN the system SHALL connect them to the existing service layer (ExceptionQueryService, ExceptionManagementService, etc.)
2. WHEN GraphQL queries are executed THEN the system SHALL delegate to the same business logic methods used by REST controllers
3. WHEN data is requested through either API THEN the system SHALL ensure GraphQL and REST responses contain equivalent data from the same sources
4. WHEN business rules are applied THEN the system SHALL use the same validation and business logic for both GraphQL and REST operations
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling and messaging across both API types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the activated GraphQL API to integrate with existing monitoring and observability infrastructure, so that I have a unified view of system performance across both APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL is activated THEN the system SHALL extend existing metrics collection to include GraphQL operations without creating separate monitoring systems
2. WHEN GraphQL requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log them using the same logging configuration and format as REST requests
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL track GraphQL response times, throughput, and error rates alongside REST metrics
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL include GraphQL functionality in existing health endpoints
5. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL extend existing alerting rules to cover GraphQL performance and error conditions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the activated GraphQL API to share the existing caching and optimization infrastructure, so that resources are used efficiently and performance is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL is activated THEN the system SHALL integrate GraphQL operations with the existing Redis caching layer
2. WHEN GraphQL queries access data THEN the system SHALL use the same database connection pooling and query optimization as REST endpoints
3. WHEN GraphQL resolvers call external services THEN the system SHALL use the existing circuit breaker and retry patterns
4. WHEN caching is performed THEN the system SHALL ensure cache consistency between REST and GraphQL operations
5. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN the system SHALL invalidate appropriate cache entries for both API types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the APIs, I want comprehensive testing and documentation for the dual API setup, so that I can verify both APIs work correctly and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL is activated THEN the system SHALL provide GraphiQL interface for development and testing
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify that GraphQL and REST APIs return equivalent data for the same operations
3. WHEN security is tested THEN the system SHALL confirm that authentication and authorization work consistently across both APIs
4. WHEN performance is tested THEN the system SHALL validate that both APIs perform within acceptable limits
5. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples and usage instructions for both API types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want the dual API configuration to be manageable through unified deployment and configuration processes, so that both APIs can be deployed and managed together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL package both REST and GraphQL functionality in the same deployment artifact
2. WHEN configuration is managed THEN the system SHALL use unified application.yml configuration for both API types
3. WHEN environment-specific settings are applied THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration for both APIs through the same configuration mechanism
4. WHEN feature flags are used THEN the system SHALL allow runtime enabling/disabling of GraphQL features without requiring separate deployments
5. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL scale both APIs together as a single application instance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to ensure the activated GraphQL implementation maintains the advanced features designed in the existing GraphQL spec, so that the BioPro Operations Dashboard can utilize all planned GraphQL capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL subscriptions are activated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates for exception events as designed in the existing GraphQL spec
2. WHEN DataLoader patterns are activated THEN the system SHALL prevent N+1 query problems and provide efficient data fetching as specified
3. WHEN query complexity controls are activated THEN the system SHALL implement security measures against resource-intensive queries as designed
4. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL support the subscription architecture defined in the existing GraphQL spec
5. WHEN GraphQL schema is loaded THEN the system SHALL provide all types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions defined in the existing design
