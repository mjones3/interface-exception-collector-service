Feature: Print Packing List
    As a DT, I want to be able to print the packing list, so that I can know the products that are placed in the box.

    Rule: I should be able to print the packing slip in the PDF format for the shipment when it is completed.
    Rule: I should be able to see the product details that are placed in the box when the shipment is completed.
    Rule: I should be able to reprint the packing slip, if needed.

            Given The shipment details are Order Number "<Order Number>", Location Code "<Location Code>" Customer ID "<Customer ID>", Customer Name "<Customer Name>", Department "<Department>", Address Line 1 "<Address Line 1>", Address Line 2 "<Address Line 2>", Address Complement "<Address Complement>", Unit Number "<Unit Number>", Product Code "<Product Code>", Product Family "<Product Family>", Blood Type "<Blood Type>", Expiration "<Expiration>", Quantity "<Quantity>".
            And I have completed a shipment with above details.
            And I am on the Shipment Fulfillment Details page.
            When I choose to print the Packing Slip.
            Then I am able to see the Packing Slip content.
