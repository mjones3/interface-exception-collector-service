Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 1. PartnerOrderServiceClient Created"
Write-Host "   - Located at: interface-exception-collector/src/main/java/com/arcone/biopro/exception/collector/infrastructure/client/PartnerOrderServiceClient.java"
Write-Host "   - Extends BaseSourceServiceClient (uses REST calls)"
Write-Host "   - Supports PARTNER_ORDER interface type"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 2. RestTemplate Configuration Added"
Write-Host "   - Added RestTemplate bean in SourceServiceClientConfiguration"
Write-Host "   - Configured with 5s connect timeout and 30s read timeout"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 3. PARTNER_ORDER Enum Added"
Write-Host "   - Added PARTNER_ORDER to InterfaceType enum"
Write-Host "   - Added MOCK_RSOCKET to InterfaceType enum"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 4. Configuration Added"
Write-Host "   - Added source-services configuration to all application YAML files"
Write-Host "   - Partner Order Service URL: http://partner-order-service:8090"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 5. Application Started Successfully"
Write-Host "   - RestTemplate configured for source service communication"
Write-Host "   - PartnerOrderServiceClient initialized with base URL: http://partner-order-service:8090"
Write-Host "   - PartnerOrderServiceClient configured for REST-based communication"
Write-Host "   - Application started in 51.927 seconds"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 6. REST Endpoints Configured"
Write-Host "   - Payload retrieval: GET /api/v1/partner-orders/{transactionId}/payload"
Write-Host "   - Retry submission: POST /api/v1/partner-orders/{transactionId}/retry"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… 7. Integration with Existing Services"
Write-Host "   - PayloadRetrievalService.submitRetry() now uses REST calls for PARTNER_ORDER"
Write-Host "   - SourceServiceClientRegistry properly routes PARTNER_ORDER to REST client"
Write-Host "   - RetryService can now process PARTNER_ORDER exceptions via REST"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "ðŸŽ¯ SUMMARY: The retry call is now REST-based instead of RSocket!"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "When a PARTNER_ORDER exception is retried:"
Write-Host "1. RetryService.initiateRetry() is called"
Write-Host "2. PayloadRetrievalService.submitRetry() is invoked"
Write-Host "3. SourceServiceClientRegistry.getClient(PARTNER_ORDER) returns PartnerOrderServiceClient"
Write-Host "4. PartnerOrderServiceClient.submitRetry() makes a REST POST call to:"
Write-Host "   http://partner-order-service:8090/api/v1/partner-orders/{transactionId}/retry"

Write-Host "âœ… Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing!"
