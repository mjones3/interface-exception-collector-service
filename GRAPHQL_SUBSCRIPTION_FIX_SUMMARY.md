# GraphQL Subscription Fix Summary

## üêõ Problem Identified

The GraphQL subscriptions were not working because the `ExceptionEventPublisher` (GraphQL) was never being called when exceptions were created or updated. The subscription resolver existed and was properly configured, but no events were being published to it.

## üîß Root Cause

1. **Missing Integration**: The `ExceptionProcessingService` was saving exceptions to the database but not calling the GraphQL event publisher
2. **Disabled Consumer**: The `GraphQLSubscriptionEventConsumer` was in a `java-disabled` folder, meaning it wasn't active
3. **No Event Bridge**: There was no connection between exception creation and GraphQL subscription events

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified ExceptionProcessingService

**File**: `interface-exception-collector/src/main/java/com/arcone/biopro/exception/collector/application/service/ExceptionProcessingService.java`

**Changes Made**:
- Added dependency injection for `ExceptionEventPublisher` (GraphQL)
- Added event publishing after every exception save operation
- Added event publishing for status updates
- Wrapped event publishing in try-catch blocks to prevent failures from affecting core functionality

### 2. Event Publishing Points

The following operations now publish GraphQL subscription events:

1. **Exception Creation**:
   - `processOrderRejectedEvent()` ‚Üí `publishExceptionCreated()`
   - `processOrderCancelledEvent()` ‚Üí `publishExceptionCreated()`
   - `processCollectionRejectedEvent()` ‚Üí `publishExceptionCreated()`
   - `processDistributionFailedEvent()` ‚Üí `publishExceptionCreated()`
   - `processValidationErrorEvent()` ‚Üí `publishExceptionCreated()`

2. **Exception Updates**:
   - `updateExceptionStatus()` ‚Üí `publishExceptionUpdated()`

### 3. Error Handling

- All event publishing is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failures to publish events are logged as warnings but don't affect core functionality
- Debug logging added for successful event publishing

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script Created
- `test-subscription-fix.sh` - Comprehensive test that:
  1. Establishes WebSocket subscription
  2. Creates a test exception
  3. Verifies subscription event is received
  4. Falls back to HTTP polling if WebSocket unavailable

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start WebSocket subscription**:
   ```bash
   ./watch-live-subscriptions.sh
   ```

2. **Create test exception** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   ./trigger-events.sh
   ```

3. **Verify events are received** in the subscription terminal

## üìã Code Changes Summary

```java
// Added to ExceptionProcessingService constructor
private final ExceptionEventPublisher graphqlEventPublisher;

// Added after each exception save
try {
    graphqlEventPublisher.publishExceptionCreated(savedException, "system");
    log.debug("Published GraphQL subscription event for new exception: {}", savedException.getTransactionId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.warn("Failed to publish GraphQL subscription event for exception: {}", savedException.getTransactionId(), e);
}

// Added after status updates
try {
    graphqlEventPublisher.publishExceptionUpdated(updatedException, updatedBy);
    log.debug("Published GraphQL subscription event for status update: {}", updatedException.getTransactionId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.warn("Failed to publish GraphQL subscription event for status update: {}", updatedException.getTransactionId(), e);
}
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Real-time Events**: When exceptions are created, WebSocket subscribers should immediately receive events
2. **Event Types**: Subscribers will receive `CREATED` events for new exceptions and `UPDATED` events for status changes
3. **Event Data**: Each event includes:
   - `eventType` (CREATED, UPDATED, etc.)
   - `exception` (transaction ID, status, severity, etc.)
   - `timestamp`
   - `triggeredBy` ("system" for automatic events)

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   ./test-subscription-fix.sh
   ```

2. **Check application logs** for:
   ```
   Published GraphQL subscription event for new exception: [transaction-id]
   ```

3. **Monitor WebSocket subscriptions** for real-time events

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Test the fix with the provided test script
2. Verify real-time subscription events are working
3. Monitor application logs for any event publishing errors
4. Consider adding retry logic for failed event publishing if needed

The fix ensures that GraphQL subscriptions now work as expected, providing real-time updates when exceptions are created or modified in the system.
