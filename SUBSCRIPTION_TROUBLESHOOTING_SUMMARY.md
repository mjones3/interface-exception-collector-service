# GraphQL Subscription Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Discovered

1. **Subscription Schema Not Registered**: The GraphQL schema introspection shows no Subscription type, despite having:
   - Proper GraphQL schema files with Subscription type defined
   - ExceptionSubscriptionResolver with @SubscriptionMapping annotations
   - All necessary dependencies (spring-boot-starter-graphql, webflux, websocket)

2. **Application Startup Issues**: After configuration changes, the application fails to start

## Root Cause Analysis

The most likely causes are:

### 1. Component Scanning Issue
The `ExceptionSubscriptionResolver` might not be in the correct package for component scanning, or there's an issue with the `@Controller` annotation.

### 2. GraphQL Auto-Configuration Problem
Spring Boot's GraphQL auto-configuration might not be properly enabled or configured for subscriptions.

### 3. Missing WebSocket Transport Configuration
Even with the correct annotations, Spring GraphQL might need explicit WebSocket transport configuration.

## Diagnostic Steps Completed

1. ✅ **Schema Files**: Confirmed subscription types exist in `schema.graphqls`
2. ✅ **Annotations**: Added `@SubscriptionMapping("exceptionUpdated")` and `@SubscriptionMapping("retryStatusUpdated")`
3. ✅ **Dependencies**: Confirmed all GraphQL, WebSocket, and WebFlux dependencies are present
4. ✅ **Event Publishing Chain**: Enhanced logging shows the complete flow from Kafka → Database → EventPublisher → SubscriptionResolver
5. ❌ **Schema Registration**: Introspection shows no Subscription type registered
6. ❌ **Application Startup**: Configuration changes causing startup failures

## Recommended Solution

### Step 1: Verify Component Scanning
Ensure the resolver is in the correct package and being scanned:

```java
// Check that this is in a package scanned by @ComponentScan
package com.arcone.biopro.exception.collector.api.graphql.resolver;

@Controller  // Ensure this annotation is present
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Slf4j
public class ExceptionSubscriptionResolver {
    
    @SubscriptionMapping("exceptionUpdated")  // Explicit field name
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('VIEWER')")
    public Flux<ExceptionUpdateEvent> exceptionUpdated(...)
```

### Step 2: Add GraphQL Configuration
Create a minimal GraphQL configuration to ensure subscriptions are enabled:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSocket
public class GraphQLConfig implements WebSocketConfigurer {
    
    @Override
    public void registerWebSocketHandlers(WebSocketHandlerRegistry registry) {
        // Register WebSocket handler for GraphQL subscriptions
        registry.addHandler(new GraphQLWebSocketHandler(), "/graphql")
                .setAllowedOrigins("*");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Application Properties
Add minimal GraphQL configuration:

```yaml
spring:
  graphql:
    websocket:
      path: /graphql
```

### Step 4: Restart and Test
1. Clean restart the application
2. Check startup logs for GraphQL subscription registration messages
3. Test schema introspection to confirm Subscription type is registered
4. Test WebSocket connection to `/graphql` endpoint

## Testing Commands

After implementing the fix:

```powershell
# 1. Test schema registration
powershell -File check-subscription-state.ps1

# 2. Test WebSocket connection (if assemblies available)
powershell -File test-websocket-only.ps1

# 3. Test end-to-end flow
powershell -File debug-event-publishing-flow-fixed.ps1
```

## Expected Results After Fix

1. **Schema Introspection**: Should show Subscription type with exceptionUpdated field
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Should connect to ws://localhost:8080/graphql successfully
3. **Event Flow**: Kafka events → Database → GraphQL subscriptions → WebSocket clients
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket clients receive exception events in real-time

## Current Status

- ✅ Event publishing chain is properly implemented with enhanced logging
- ✅ WebSocket transport configuration exists
- ❌ Subscription resolver not being registered with GraphQL schema
- ❌ Application startup issues after configuration changes

The core issue is that the `@SubscriptionMapping` annotations are not being processed by Spring GraphQL's schema registration, likely due to component scanning or auto-configuration issues.

## Next Actions

1. **Start application manually** and check startup logs for errors
2. **Verify component scanning** is including the resolver package
3. **Add minimal GraphQL configuration** if auto-configuration isn't working
4. **Test schema registration** after each change
5. **Implement WebSocket transport** once schema is properly registered

The WebSocket subscription infrastructure is correctly implemented - we just need to get the GraphQL schema to recognize the subscription resolvers.
