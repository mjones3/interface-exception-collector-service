# Task 16: Monitoring and Observability Features - Implementation Summary

## Completed Sub-tasks

### ✅ 1. Add Micrometer metrics for exception processing rates and API response times
- **MetricsConfig.java**: Configured comprehensive metrics beans including:
  - Exception processing counters and timers
  - API response time timers
  - Retry operation metrics
  - Critical alert counters
  - Kafka message processing metrics
  - Database operation metrics
  - External service call metrics

- **MetricsAspect.java**: Implemented AOP-based automatic metrics collection for:
  - REST API endpoints (response times, status codes)
  - Service layer methods (processing times)
  - Database operations (query times, success/failure rates)
  - Kafka consumers/producers (message processing times)
  - External service calls (call duration, success rates)

### ✅ 2. Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- **LoggingConfig.java**: Comprehensive structured logging configuration with:
  - Correlation ID filter for HTTP requests
  - MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) management
  - Utility methods for setting transaction ID, interface type, user ID
  - Context management for async operations
  - Automatic correlation ID propagation

- **logback-spring.xml**: Configured structured logging with:
  - JSON format for production environments
  - Human-readable format for local development
  - Correlation ID, transaction ID, and interface type in log context
  - Async file appender for performance
  - Proper log rotation and retention

### ✅ 3. Create custom metrics for business KPIs (exception volumes, resolution times)
- **MetricsService.java**: Implemented business metrics tracking:
  - Exception processing rates by interface type and severity
  - Retry operation success/failure rates
  - Critical alert generation tracking
  - Active exceptions count (gauge)
  - Daily exception counts (gauge)
  - Average resolution time calculations (gauge)
  - Real-time atomic counters for performance

- **MetricsInitializer.java**: Automated metrics initialization and maintenance:
  - Application startup metrics initialization
  - Daily counter reset scheduling
  - System health status logging every 5 minutes
  - Gauge metrics for real-time monitoring

### ✅ 4. Configure Prometheus metrics export
- **application.yml**: Configured Prometheus metrics export with:
  - Enabled Prometheus endpoint at `/actuator/prometheus`
  - Configured percentile histograms for key metrics
  - Set up distribution statistics for performance metrics
  - Added common tags for service identification
  - Configured metric collection intervals

- **Dependencies**: Micrometer Prometheus registry included in pom.xml
- **Endpoints**: Actuator endpoints exposed for metrics collection

### ✅ 5. Add health indicators for database and Kafka connectivity
- **DatabaseHealthIndicator.java**: Database connectivity health checks
- **KafkaHealthIndicator.java**: Kafka cluster health monitoring  
- **CacheHealthIndicator.java**: Redis cache connectivity checks
- **application.yml**: Health check configuration with detailed status reporting

## Requirements Satisfied

### US-016: Publish Exception Lifecycle Events
✅ Metrics tracking for all exception lifecycle events
✅ Event correlation and causation tracking
✅ Structured logging for event processing

### US-017: Maintain Event Correlation  
✅ Correlation ID propagation across all operations
✅ Transaction ID tracking in logs and metrics
✅ Interface type context maintenance
✅ Event causation chain preservation

## Verification

The monitoring and observability features have been implemented and integrated throughout the application. Key verification points:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Automatic collection via AOP aspects
2. **Structured Logging**: Correlation IDs in all log entries
3. **Business KPIs**: Real-time gauges and counters
4. **Prometheus Export**: Metrics available at `/actuator/prometheus`
5. **Health Checks**: Database, Kafka, and Cache connectivity monitoring

## Next Steps

To complete the monitoring setup:
1. Deploy to environment with Prometheus scraping configured
2. Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization
3. Configure alerting rules based on the exported metrics
4. Verify log aggregation in centralized logging system

The core monitoring and observability infrastructure is now in place and ready for production use.
