Create BDD steps using Cucumber/Java to cover the following BDD scenarios from a graphql API

Scenario: Successfully retrieve shipment details via API
        Given a shipment exists with number "SHP-2024-001"
        When I send a GET request to "/api/shipments/SHP-2024-001"
        Then the response status code should be 200
        And the response should contain the following shipment information:
            | field                       | value         |
            | shipmentNumber             | SHP-2024-001  |
            | customerCode               | CUST001       |
            | customerName               | Test Customer |
            | productType                | Plasma        |
            | shipmentStatus             | Created       |
            | shipmentDate               | 2024-01-20    |
            | transportationReferenceNo  | TRN001        |
            | totalProducts              | 100           |
            | totalCartons               | 20            |

Scenario: Attempt to retrieve non-existent shipment
        When I send a GET request to "/api/shipments/NON-EXISTENT"
        Then the response status code should be 404
        And the response should contain error message "Shipment not found"
