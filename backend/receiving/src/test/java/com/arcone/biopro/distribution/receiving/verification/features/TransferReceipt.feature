Feature: Transfer Receipt

    Background: Clean-up
        Given I have removed all imports using thermometer which code contains "-DST-456".
        And I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-456".
        And I have removed all internal transfers which order number contains "45600001,45600002,45600003,45600004,45600005,45600006,45600007,45600008"

   Rule: The system should show the appropriate fields based on the given internal transfer number.
   Rule: I should be able to input transfer details like transfer order number, transit date and time, temperature, thermometer ID and comments as necessary.
