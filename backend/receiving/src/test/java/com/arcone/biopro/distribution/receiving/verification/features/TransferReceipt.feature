Feature: Transfer Receipt

    Background: Clean-up
        Given I have removed all imports using thermometer which code contains "-DST-456".
        And I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-456".
        And I have removed all internal transfers which order number contains "45600001,45600002,45600003,45600004"

    Rule: The system should show the appropriate fields based on the given internal transfer number.
        Rule: The system should define the time zone based of the user location for the “Transit Start Time” field based on the internal transfer information.
    Rule: I should be notified when internal transfer order assigned to different facility.
        Rule: The comments field is required if internal transfer order received in a different facility.


    Rule: I should be able to input transfer details like transfer order number, transit date and time, temperature, thermometer ID and comments as necessary.
        Rule: I should be able to see the total transit time of the internal transfer if applicable.
    Rule: The system should define the time zone based of the user location for the “Transit End Time” field.
        Rule: I should be notified if the transit time is out of configured range.
    Rule: I should be able to enter temperature information of the internal transfer products.
        Rule: I should be notified when I enter a temperature that is out of the configured range.
    Rule: I should be able to enter the temperature in decimals.
        Rule: I should be able to enter the thermometer ID configured for location where internal transfer products are received.

    Rule: I should be notified when I enter a thermometer ID that is not configured for the location.
        Rule: I should not be able to proceed if the thermometer ID that is not configured for the location.
    Rule: I should not be able to enter the temperature information if the thermometer is not valid.
        Rule: I should not be able to proceed to the product information until all the required packing information is entered.
    Rule: The transit start date cannot be before transit end date.
        Rule: The transit end date cannot be in the future.
