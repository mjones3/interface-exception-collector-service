Feature: Import products

    Background: Clean-up
        Given I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-".

    Rule: I should be able to input shipping details like product category, transit date and time, temperature, thermometer ID and comments as necessary.
    Rule: The system should show the appropriate fields based on the selected product category.
    @api @DIS-406
    Scenario Outline: Request to enter shipping information
        Given I request to enter shipping data for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
        Then I should be able to enter information for the following attributes: "<Attributes to Fill>".
        Examples:
            | Temperature Category | Attributes to Fill                                       |

            When I select to enter information for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
            Then I "should" be able to fill the following fields: "<Attributes to Fill>".

        @api @DIS-410
        Scenario Outline: Successfully record temperature within acceptable range
            Given The following temperature thresholds are configured:
                | Temperature Category | Min Temperature | Max Temperature |
                | REFRIGERATED         |    1            |  10             |
                | ROOM_TEMPERATURE     |    20           |  24             |
            When I request to validate the temperature of "<Temperature>" for the Temperature Category "<Temperature Category>".
            Then The system "should" accept the temperature.
            Examples:
                |Temperature Category | Temperature |
                | REFRIGERATED        |  9          |
                | ROOM_TEMPERATURE    |  22         |

        Rule: I should be notified when I enter a temperature that is out of the configured range.

            When I request to validate the temperature of "<Temperature>" for the Temperature Category "<Temperature Category>".
            Then I should receive a "<message_type>" message response "<message>".
            Examples:
                |Temperature Category | Temperature | message_type | message                                                               |

        Scenario Outline: Enter temperature within acceptable different ranges
            Given I have a thermometer configured as location "<Device Location Code>", Device ID as "<Device ID>", Category as "<Device Category>" and Device Type as "<Device Type>".
            And The following temperature thresholds are configured:
                | Temperature Category | Min Temperature | Max Temperature |

            And The user location is "<Imports Location Code>".
            And I am at the Enter Shipping Information Page.
            And I select to enter information for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
            Then The temperature field should be "disabled".
            When I enter thermometer ID "<thermometer ID>".
            Then The temperature field should be "<Temperature Field Status>".
            When I enter the temperature "<Temperature>".
            Then The continue option should be "<continue_status>".
            And  I "<should_should_not>" see a "Caution" alert: "Temperature does not meet thresholds all products will be quarantined".
