    Scenario Outline: Request to enter shipping information
        Given I request to enter shipping data for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
        Then I should be able to enter information for the following attributes: "<Attributes to Fill>".
        Examples:
            | Temperature Category | Attributes to Fill                                       |

            When I select to enter information for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
            Then I "should" be able to fill the following fields: "<Attributes to Fill>".

    Rule: I should be able to enter the thermometer ID configured for location where products are imported.
    Rule: I should be notified when I enter a thermometer ID that is not configured for the location.
    Rule: I should not be able to proceed if the thermometer ID that is not configured for the location.
    Rule: I should be notified when I enter a device that is not a “Thermometer” and its category is not “Temperature”.
    Rule: I should not be able to enter the temperature information if the thermometer is not valid.

    Scenario Outline: Validate different thermometer scenarios
        Given I have a thermometer configured as location "<Device Location Code>", Device ID as "<Device ID>", Category as "<Device Category>" and Device Type as "<Device Type>".
        When I enter thermometer ID "<thermometer ID>" for the location code "<Imports Location Code>" and Temperature Category "<Temperature Category>".
        Then I should receive a "<message_type>" message response "<message>".
        Examples:
        |Imports Location Code | Device Location Code | thermometer ID | Device ID | Temperature Category | Device Type | Device Category   | message_type | message                          |

    Scenario Outline: Successfully enter a valid thermometer ID for the location
        Given I have a thermometer configured as location "<Device Location Code>", Device ID as "<Device ID>", Category as "<Device Category>" and Device Type as "<Device Type>".
        And The user location is "<Imports Location Code>".
        And I am at the Enter Shipping Information Page.
        And I select to enter information for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
        Then The temperature field should be "disabled"
        When I enter thermometer ID "<thermometer ID>"
        Then The temperature field should be "<Temperature Field Status>"
        Examples:
            |Imports Location Code | Device Location Code | thermometer ID | Device ID | Temperature Category | Device Type | Device Category | Temperature Field Status |
            | 123456789            |   123456789          | THERM-001      | THERM-001 |  ROOM_TEMPERATURE    | THERMOMETER | TEMPERATURE     | enabled                  |


    Rule: I should not be able to enter the temperature information if the thermometer is not valid.
