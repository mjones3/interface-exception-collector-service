Feature: Import products

    Background: Clean-up
        Given I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-410".
        And I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-411".

    Rule: I should be able to input shipping details like product category, transit date and time, temperature, thermometer ID and comments as necessary.
    Rule: The system should show the appropriate fields based on the selected product category.
    Rule: The system should define the time zone based on the user location for the “Transit Time Zone to” field.
    Rule: The system should pre-populate the current user location date and time by default.

        Rule: I should be notified if the transit time is out of configured range.

        Scenario Outline: Notification for out-of-range transit time
            Given The following transit time thresholds are configured:
                | Temperature Category | Min Transit Time | Max Transit Time |
                | ROOM_TEMPERATURE     |    1             |  24              |
            When I request to validate the total transit time of Stat date time as "<StartDateTime>", Start Time Zone as "<StartTimeZone>", End date time as "<EndDateTime>" and End Time Zone as "<EndTimeZone>"  for the Temperature Category "<Temperature Category>".
            Then I should receive a "<message_type>" message response "<message>".
            Examples:
                |Temperature Category | StartDateTime              | StartTimeZone    | EndDateTime              | EndTimeZone      |message_type | message                                                               |

        Rule: I should be able to see the total transit time of the imported products.
        Rule: The system should define the time zone based on the user location for the “Transit Time Zone to” field.
        Rule: The system should pre-populate the current user location date and time by default.
        Rule: I should be notified if the transit time is out of configured range.
        @ui @DIS-411
        Scenario Outline: Enter transit time within different ranges
            Given The following transit time thresholds are configured:
                | Temperature Category | Min Transit Time | Max Transit Time |
                | ROOM_TEMPERATURE     |    1             |  24              |

            And The location default timezone is configured as "<defaultLocationTimeZone>"
            And The user location is "<Imports Location Code>".
            And I am at the Enter Shipping Information Page.
            And I select to enter information for a "<Temperature Category>" product category.
            Then I the end time zone field should be pre defined as "<defaultLocationTimeZoneSelected>".
            And I enter the Stat date time as "<StartDateTime>", Start Time Zone as "<StartTimeZone>", End date time as "<EndDateTime>".
            ## Check with the team/PO if we should have a button to trigger the calculation or not
            When I choose calculate total transit time.
            Then The continue option should be "<continue_status>"
            And I "<should_should_not_transit>" see the total transit time as "<totalTransitTime>"
            And  I "<should_should_not_caution>" see a "CAUTION" message: "Total Transit Time does not meet thresholds all products will be quarantined".
