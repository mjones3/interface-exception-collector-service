Feature: Enter Imported Products Information

    Background: Clean-up
        Given I have removed all imports using thermometer which code contains "-DST-412".
        And I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-412".

    Rule: I should be required to enter unit number, ABO/Rh, product code, expiration date and license status for all the imported products.
