Feature: Enter Imported Products Information

    Background: Clean-up
        Given I have removed all imports using thermometer which code contains "-DST-412".
        And I have removed all created devices which ID contains "-DST-412".

    Rule: I should be required to enter unit number, ABO/Rh, product code, expiration date and license status for all the imported products.

            Given I have a thermometer configured as location "<Device Location Code>", Device ID as "<Device ID>", Category as "<Device Category>" and Device Type as "<Device Type>".
            And The following temperature thresholds are configured:
                | Temperature Category | Min Temperature | Max Temperature |
                | REFRIGERATED         |    1            |  10             |
