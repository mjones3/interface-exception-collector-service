Feature: Complete Shipment Feature
    As a distribution technician, I want to complete a shipment, so I can ship products to the customer.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the packed item that used the unit number "W036898786802,W812530106086,W812530106089,W036824705327,W812530106090".
        And I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117".

        Rule: I should be able to complete a shipment whenever at least one product is filledRule: I should be able to view the list of packed products added once it is filled on the Shipment Fulfillment Details page.
        Rule: I should see a success message when the shipment is completed.
        Rule: I should be able to view the shipping details of the products once it is shipped on the Shipment Fulfillment Details page.
        Rule: I should not be able to see the pending log once the order is completely filled, shipped, or closed. (This is going to be tested on Shipment Fulfillment Details page and Fill Shipment page)
        Rule: I should be able to view the pending log of products to be filled for each line item on the Shipment Fulfillment Details page.
        Rule: I should be able to complete the shipment process without second verification if configured by the blood center.
