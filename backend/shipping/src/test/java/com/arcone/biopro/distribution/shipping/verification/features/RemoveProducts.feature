Feature: Remove Product from a Shipment

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "3001,3002,3003,3004,3005".

    Rule: I should be able to remove one, multiple, or all products from the order until the product status has been moved to shipped status.
        Rule: The pending log should be updated if the product(s) is removed once it is filled.
