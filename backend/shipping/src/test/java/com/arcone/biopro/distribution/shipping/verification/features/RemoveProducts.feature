Feature: Remove Product from a Shipment
  As a Distribution Technician,
  I want to remove products from a shipment,
  so that I can ensure that only the correct and relevant items are shipped to the customer.


  Background:
    Given I cleaned up from the database the packed item that used the unit number "W036898786801,W822530103001,W822530103002,W822530103003,W822530103004,W822530103005,W822530103006,W822530103007".
    And I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "3001,3002,3003,3004,3005".

  Rule: I should be able to remove one, multiple, or all products from the order until the product status has been moved to shipped status.
    Rule: The pending log should be updated if the product(s) is removed once it is filled.

    Scenario Outline: Remove Product from a Shipment.
      Given I have a shipment for order "<Order Number>" with the units "<Units>" and product codes "<Product Codes>" of family "<Product Family>" and blood type "<Blood Type>" "packed", out of <Quantity Requested> requested.
      And The second verification configuration is "disabled".
      When I remove the product "<Unit Removed>" with product code "<Code Removed>" from the line item "<Product Family>" "<Blood Type>".
      Then The product "<Unit Removed>" and "<Code Removed>" should not be part of the shipment.
      And I should receive a "success" message response "Product(s) successfully removed".
      And I should have <Expected Qty> items "packed".

        # add more product family
      Examples:
        | Order Number | Product Codes              | Units                                     | Product Family      | Blood Type | Unit Removed  | Code Removed | Expected Qty | Quantity Requested |
        | 3001         | E0685V00,E0685V00,E0685V00 | W822530103001,W822530103002,W822530103003 | PLASMA_TRANSFUSABLE | B          | W822530103001 | E0685V00     | 2            | 10                 |

      And The second verification configuration is "enabled".
      When I remove the product "<Unit Removed>" with product code "<Code Removed>" from the line item "<Product Family>" "<Blood Type>".
      Then The product "<Unit Removed>" and "<Code Removed>" should not be part of the shipment.
      And I should receive a "success" message response "Product(s) successfully removed".
      And I should have 0 items "verified".
      Examples:

      And I have completed a shipment with above details.
