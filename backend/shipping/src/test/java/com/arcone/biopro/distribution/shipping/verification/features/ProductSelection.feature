Feature: Fill Unlabeled Products for Internal Transfer order

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "452000016,452000017,452000018,452000019,452000020,452000021".

        Rule: I should be able to see all available products for a given unit number.
        Rule: I should be able to select unlabeled products to fill an internal transfer order.
