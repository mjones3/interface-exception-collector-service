Feature: Cancel Verification Second Verification of Units Feature
    As a DT,
    I should be able to cancel the second verification process,
    So that I can stop the verification process.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the packed item that used the unit number "W825530106087".
        And I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "125".


        Rule: I should be able to cancel the second verification process (at any time) before submitting.
        Rule: I should see a confirmation message stating that all verified products at the current step will be removed.
        Rule: I should be able to abort the cancellation process and resume the second verification.
        Rule: I should not see any verified products when I confirm the cancellation.
        Rule: I should return to the shipment details page when I confirm the cancellation and will receive a message that the cancellation was successful.
