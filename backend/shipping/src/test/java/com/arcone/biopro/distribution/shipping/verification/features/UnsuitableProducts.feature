Feature: Prevent filling a shipment with unsuitable products
    As a distribution technician, I want to prevent filling a shipment with unsuitable products, so that I can avoid shipping the wrong products to the customer.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "999771,999778,999764,999779,999765,999766,999767,999768,999769,999770,999771,999772,999773,999774,999775,999776,4440009".

    Scenario Outline: Entering an unsuitable product
        Given The shipment details are order Number "<orderNumber>", customer ID "<Customer ID>", Customer Name "<Customer Name>", Product Details: Quantities "<Quantity>", Blood Types: "<BloodType>", Product Families "<ProductFamily>".
        And I have received a shipment fulfillment request with above details.
        When I am on the Shipment Fulfillment Details page.
        And I choose to fill product of family "<Family Description>" and blood type "<BloodType>".
        And I add the unit "<UN>" with product code "<Code>".
        When I define visual inspection as "<Inspection>", if needed.
        Then I should see a "<Message Type>" message: "<Message>".
        And I should not see the unit "<UN>" with product code "<Code>" added to the filled products table.

        Examples:
