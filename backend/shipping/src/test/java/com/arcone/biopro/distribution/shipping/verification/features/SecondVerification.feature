Feature: Second Verification of Units Feature
    As a distribution technician,
    I want to perform a second verification of the products in a shipment (if configured),
    So that I can ensure that the products recorded in the system match the physical products inside the shipping box.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the packed item that used the unit number "W822530106087,W822530106089,W822530106088,W822530106090,W822530106091".
        And I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "118,119,120".


        Rule: I should be able to verify each unit that I have packed in the shipment.
        Rule: I should be able to see the progress of units that are being verified.
        Rule: I should be able to see all the verified units.
        Rule: I should see the complete shipment option available once all the units are verified.
        Rule: I should be able to see the shipping information.
        Rule: I should be able to see the order information.

        Scenario Outline: Second verification packed units.
            Given I have a shipment for order "<Order Number>" with the unit "<UN>" and product code "<Code>" packed.
            And The second verification configuration is "enabled".
            And I am on the Shipment Fulfillment Details page for order <Order Number>.
            When I choose verify products.
            Then I should be redirected to the verify products page.
            And I can see the Order Information Details and the Shipping Information Details.
            When I scan the unit "<UN>" with product code "<Code>".
            Then I should see the unit added to the verified products table.
            And I should see the log of verified products being updated.
            And The complete shipment option should be enabled.
           Examples:
               | Order Number | Code     | UN            |
               | 118          | E0685V00 | W822530106087 |


        Rule: I should be notified when I scan a unit that is not part of the shipment.
        Rule: I should not be able to complete the shipment if all the units are not verified.
