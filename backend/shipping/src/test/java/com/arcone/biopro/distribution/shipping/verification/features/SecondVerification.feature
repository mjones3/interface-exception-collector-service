Feature: Second Verification of Units Feature
    As a distribution technician,
    I want to perform a second verification of the products in a shipment (if configured),
    So that I can ensure that the products recorded in the system match the physical products inside the shipping box.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the packed item that used the unit number "W822530106087,W822530106089,W822530106088,W822530106090,W822530106091,W822530106092,W822530106093,W822530106094,W036898786756,W036898786757,W036898786758,W036898786700,W036898445759,W036898445758,W036898445760,W036825185915,W036825158907,W036825158914,W036825151116,W036825151117,W036825151118,W036825151119".
        And I cleaned up from the database, all shipments with order number "118,119,120,121,122,123,124,44500010,45300005,45300006,45300007,45300008".


        Rule: I should be able to verify each unit that I have packed in the shipment.
        Rule: I should be able to see the progress of units that are being verified.
        Rule: I should be able to see all the verified units.
        Rule: I should see the complete shipment option available once all the units are verified.
        Rule: I should be able to see the shipping information.
        Rule: I should be able to see the order information.

            And I should see the log of verified products being updated.
            And The complete shipment option should be enabled.
            Examples:

                | 118          | E0685V00 | W822530106087 |


        Rule: I should be notified when I scan a unit that is not part of the shipment.
        Rule: I should not be able to complete the shipment if all the units are not verified.

            And  I should not see the unit added to the verified products table.
            And The complete shipment option should not be enabled.

            Then I should see a field validation error message "<Field Error Message>".
            And The "Product Code" field should be "disabled".
