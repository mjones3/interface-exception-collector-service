Feature: External Transfers


    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the product locations history that used the unit number "W036898786807,W812530106085,W812530106095".
        And I cleaned up from the database the external transfer information that used the customer code "A1235,B2346,C3457".

    Rule: I should be able to record the transfer customer, transfer date, and hospital order reference ID.

            When I create an external transfer request to the customer "<Customer Code To>", hospital transfer id "<Transfer ID>" and transfer date "<Transfer Date>".
            Then I should have an external transfer request created.
            Examples:
                | Transfer Date | Customer Code To | Transfer ID |
                | 2025-02-01    | A1235            | 123         |
                | 2025-01-01    | A1235            | NULL_VALUE  |


        Rule: I should be alerted and not proceed ahead if the transfer date entered is in the future.
        Rule: I should not be able to proceed if transfer customer and transfer date are not valid.
