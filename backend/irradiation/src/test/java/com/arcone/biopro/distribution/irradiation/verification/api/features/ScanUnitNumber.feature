    Scenario Outline: I successfully scan a unit number with a product eligible for irradiation
        Given I have the following inventory products:

        And I'm in the irradiation service at the location "<Location>"
        When I scan the unit number "<Unit Number>" in irradiation
        Then I verify that there are only 1 product(s) eligible for irradiation for the unit number "<Unit Number>"
        Then I see the product "<Product Code>" from unit number "<Unit Number>" is in the list of products for selection
        Examples:
            | Unit Number   | Location  | Product Code |
            | W777725001001 | 123456789 | E0869V00     |
