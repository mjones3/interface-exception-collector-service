Feature: Close Irradiation Batch

    Rule: As a distribution specialist, I want to indicate irradiation status for each unit of the batch so that I can close the irradiation process
        @LAB-621 @LAB-622
        Scenario Outline: I can close an irradiation batch.
            Given An irradiation batch has been started with the following units for irradiator "<Irradiator Id>"
                | Unit Number     | Product Code     | Lot Number |
                | <Unit Number 1> | <Product Code 1> | Lot 123    |
                | <Unit Number 1> | <Product Code 2> | Lot 1234   |
                | <Unit Number 2> | <Product Code 1> | Lot 12345  |
            And I login to Distribution module

            And I verify that I am "Unable" to "Submit"
            And I verify that I am "Unable" to "Cancel"

            When On the "Close Irradiation" page, I scan the irradiator id "<Irradiator Id>"
            Then On the "Close Irradiation" page, I verify that the "Unit Number" field is "enabled"
            And On the "Close Irradiation" page, I verify that the "Irradiator Id" field is "disabled"
            And I verify that I am "Unable" to "Submit"
            And I verify that I am "Able" to "Cancel"
            And On the "Close Irradiation" page, I verify that the unit number "<Unit Number 1>" with product "<Description 1>" was added to the batch
            And On the "Close Irradiation" page, I verify that the unit number "<Unit Number 1>" with product "<Description 2>" was added to the batch
            And On the "Close Irradiation" page, I verify that the unit number "<Unit Number 2>" with product "<Description 1>" was added to the batch

            When On the "Close Irradiation" page, I scan the unit number "=<Unit Number 1>00"
            And I select the product "<Product Code 1>"
            And On the "Close Irradiation" page, I scan the unit number "=<Unit Number 1>00"
            And I select the product "<Product Code 2>"
            And On the "Close Irradiation" page, I scan the unit number "=<Unit Number 2>00"
            And I select the product "<Product Code 1>"
            Then I verify that I am "Able" to "Record Inspection"

            When On the Close Irradiation page, I click to select all units in the batch
            And On the Close Irradiation page, I click on Record Inspection
