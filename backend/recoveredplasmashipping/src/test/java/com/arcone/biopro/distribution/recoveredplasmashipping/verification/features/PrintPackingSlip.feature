    Background:
        Given I have removed from the database all the configurations for the location "123456789_DIS343".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments which code contains with "DIS34300".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments from location "123456789" with transportation ref number "DIS-343".
        And The location "123456789_DIS343" is configured with prefix "DIS_343", shipping code "DIS34300", carton prefix "BPM" and prefix configuration "Y".
        And I have reset the shipment product criteria to have the following values:

    Rule: The system should trigger the printing of the carton automatically once a carton is closed.
        Rule: I should be able to print the carton packing slip with the carton details and products information.
        @ui @DIS-343
        Scenario Outline: Automatic printing when carton is closed
            Given I have an empty carton created with the Customer Code as "<Customer Code>" , Product Type as "<Product Type>", Carton Tare Weight as "<Carton Tare Weight>", Shipment Date as "<Shipment Date>", Transportation Reference Number as "<Transportation Reference Number>" and Location Code as "<Location Code>".
            And The Minimum Number of Units in Carton is configured as "<configured_min_products>" products for the customer code "<Customer Code>" and product type "<Product Type>".
            And I have verified product with the unit number "<unit_number>", product code "<product_code>" and product type "<product_type>".
            And  I navigate to the Manage Carton Products page for the carton sequence number <Carton Sequence Number>.
            When I choose to close the carton.
            Then I should be redirected to the Shipment Details page.
            And I should be able to see the Carton Packing Slip details.
            Examples:
                | Customer Code | Product Type              | Carton Tare Weight | Shipment Date | Transportation Reference Number | Location Code | configured_min_products | unit_number                     | product_code       | product_type                                           |
                | 408           | RP_FROZEN_WITHIN_24_HOURS | 1000               | <tomorrow>    | DIS-343                         | 123456789     | 2                       | W03689878680600,W03689878680700 | E2488V00, E2488V00 | RP_NONINJECTABLE_LIQUID_RT, RP_NONINJECTABLE_LIQUID_RT |


    Rule: I should be able to reprint carton packing slip if needed.
        Rule: The Testing Statement displayed on the carton packing slip must be configurable.
        @api @DIS-343
        Scenario: Manual printing of carton packing slip
            Given I have an empty carton created with the Customer Code as "409" , Product Type as "RP_NONINJECTABLE_LIQUID_RT", Carton Tare Weight as "1000", Shipment Date as "<tomorrow>", Transportation Reference Number as "DIS-343" and Location Code as "123456789".
            And The Minimum Number of Units in Carton is configured as "2" products for the customer code "409" and product type "RP_NONINJECTABLE_LIQUID_RT".
            And The system configuration "TESTING_STATEMENT_TXT" is configured as "Testing statement template: {employeeName}" for the element "testingStatement" in the process type "RPS_CARTON_PACKING_SLIP".
            And I have verified product with the unit number "W036898786808,W036898786809", product code "E2488V00, E2488V00" and product type "RP_FROZEN_WITHIN_120_HOURS, RP_FROZEN_WITHIN_120_HOURS".
            And I request to close the carton.
            When I request to print the carton packing slip.
            Then The carton packing slip should contain:
