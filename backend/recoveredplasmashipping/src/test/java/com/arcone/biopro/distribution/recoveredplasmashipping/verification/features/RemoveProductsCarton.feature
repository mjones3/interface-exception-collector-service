Feature: Remove Products from Carton

    Background:
        Given I have removed from the database all the configurations for the location "123456789_DIS385".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments which code contains with "DIS38500".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments from location "123456789" with transportation ref number "DIS-385".
        And The location "123456789_DIS385" is configured with prefix "DIS_385", shipping code "DIS38500", carton prefix "BPM" and prefix configuration "Y".
        And I have reset the shipment product criteria to have the following values:
            | recovered_plasma_shipment_criteria_id | type                    | value | message                                   | message_type |

        Rule: I should be able to remove one or more products from the selected carton.
        Rule: I should receive a success message once the products are successfully removed.
        @api @DIS-385
        Scenario Outline: Successfully remove products from an open carton
            Given I have a shipment created with the Customer Code as "<Customer Code>" , Product Type as "<Product Type>", Carton Tare Weight as "<Carton Tare Weight>", Shipment Date as "<Shipment Date>", Transportation Reference Number as "<Transportation Reference Number>" and Location Code as "<Location Code>".
            And The Minimum Number of Units in Carton is configured as "3" products for the customer code "<Customer Code>" and product type "<Product Type>".
            And I have a "OPEN" carton with the "PACKED" unit numbers as "<unit_number>" and product codes as "<product_code>" and product types "<product_type>".
            When I request to remove the products "<unit_number>" with product codes "<product_code>" from the carton.
            Then I should receive a "SUCCESS" message response "Product successfully removed".
            And The product unit number "<unit_number>" and product code "<product_code>" "should not" be packed in the carton.
            Examples:
                | Customer Code | Product Type               | Carton Tare Weight | Shipment Date | Transportation Reference Number | Location Code    | unit_number    | product_code | product_type               |

        Rule: I should not be able to remove products when the carton is CLOSED.

            Given I have a shipment created with the Customer Code as "<Customer Code>" , Product Type as "<Product Type>", Carton Tare Weight as "<Carton Tare Weight>", Shipment Date as "<Shipment Date>", Transportation Reference Number as "<Transportation Reference Number>" and Location Code as "<Location Code>".
            And The Minimum Number of Units in Carton is configured as "3" products for the customer code "<Customer Code>" and product type "<Product Type>".
            And I have a "CLOSED" carton with the "VERIFIED" unit numbers as "<unit_number>" and product codes as "<product_code>" and product types "<product_type>".
            When I request to remove the products "<unit_number>" with product codes "<product_code>" from the carton.
            Then I should receive a "WARN" message response "Cannot remove products from a closed carton".
            And The product unit number "<unit_number>" and product code "<product_code>" "should" be verified in the carton.
            Examples:
