    Rule: I should be able to only scan the unit number and product code.
    Rule: I should be able to view the products added to the carton with information like unit number and product code.
    Rule: Verify acceptability of the products as they are added to the carton.
    Rule: I should be able to view shipping information.

    Scenario Outline: Successfully add product to carton by scanning
        Given I have an empty carton created with the Customer Code as "<Customer Code>" , Product Type as "<Product Type>", Carton Tare Weight as "<Carton Tare Weight>", Shipment Date as "<Shipment Date>", Transportation Reference Number as "<Transportation Reference Number>" and Location Code as "<Location Code>".
        And I navigate to the Add Carton Products page for the carton sequence number <Carton Sequence Number>.
        When I add an "acceptable" product with the unit number "<unit_number>", product code "<product_code>" and product type "<product_type>".
        Then I should see the product in the packed list with unit number "<unit_number>" and product code "<product_code>".
        When I navigate to the shipment details page for the last shipment created.
        Then I should see a list of all cartons.
        And I should see the unit "<unit_number>" added to the carton sequence "<Carton Sequence Number>".
        Examples:
            | Customer Code | Product Type              | Carton Tare Weight | Shipment Date | Transportation Reference Number | Location Code | Carton Sequence Number | unit_number      | product_code | product_type              | total_products |
