        Rule: I should be able to identify when a carton needs to be repacked.
        Rule: I should be requested to confirm the repack of a carton.
        Rule: I should be required to provide repack reason comments.
        Rule: The system should remove all products once I confirm the repack.
        Rule: The system should not remove products when I cancel the repack.
        Rule: I should be able to add products in the same carton.

        Scenario: Successfully repack a carton.
            Given I have a shipment created with the Customer Code as "409" , Product Type as "RP_NONINJECTABLE_LIQUID_RT", Carton Tare Weight as "1000", Shipment Date as "<tomorrow>", Transportation Reference Number as "DIS-355" and Location Code as "123456789_DIS355".

            And I navigate to the shipment details page for the last shipment created.
            Then I should see the following shipment information:

            And The repack option should be available for the carton number prefix "BPMMH1" and sequence number "1" and status "REPACK".
            When I choose to repack the carton number prefix "BPMMH1" and sequence number "1" and status "REPACK".
            Then I should see a "Repack carton" message: "Are you sure you want to repack this carton? All products will be removed.".
            When I choose cancel the repack carton.
            Then The status of the carton number prefix "BPMMH1" and sequence number "1" should be "REPACK".
            When I choose to repack the carton number prefix "BPMMH1" and sequence number "1" and status "REPACK".
            Then I should see a "Repack carton" message: "Are you sure you want to repack this carton? All products will be removed.".
            And I enter reason comments "comments".
            When I confirm to repack the carton.
            Then I should see a "SUCCESS" message: "Products successfully removed".
            And I should be redirected to the Manage Carton Products page.
            And The product unit number "<unit_number>" and product code "<product_code>" "should not" be packed in the carton.
