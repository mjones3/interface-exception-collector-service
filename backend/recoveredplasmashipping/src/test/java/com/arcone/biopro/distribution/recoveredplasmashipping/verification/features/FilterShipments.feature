Feature: Filter Shipments

    Background:
        Given I have removed from the database all the configurations for the location "123456700_TEST".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments which code contains with "DIS33400".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments which code contains with "DIS37100".
        And I have removed from the database all shipments from location "123456789" with transportation ref number "DIS334".

        Rule: I should be able to filter the shipment lists by specific criteria.
        Rule: The system should not enable the Apply options until at least one filter criteria is chosen.

        Scenario: Filter shipments through UI with multiple criteria
            Given I request to create a new shipment with the values:
                | Field                           | Value                         |

                | Transportation Reference Number | DIS334                        |
                | Location Code                   | 123456789                     |
            When I am on the Shipment List Page.
            And I open the filter panel.
            Then The Filter Apply button should be "disabled".
            When I select the following filter criteria:
                | Customer                        | Bio Products                  |
                | Product Type                    | RP NONINJECTABLE REFRIGERATED |
                | Location                        | MDL Hub 1                     |

                | Transportation Reference Number | DIS334                        |
            And I enter shipment date range from "<today>" to "<tomorrow>".
            Then The Filter Apply button should be "enabled".
            When I click the Filter Apply button.
            Then I should see filtered shipments matching the criteria.
            And I should see "6" filter criteria applied.


        Rule: I should be able to search by
        Shipment Number, Customer, Product Type, Shipment Status,
        Shipment Date Range, Location and Transportation Reference Number as filter Options.
        Rule: I should be able to multi-select for Customer, Product Type, Shipment Status and Location.

    # The system should not enable the Apply options until at least one filter criteria is chosen.
    #  I should be able to multi-select for Customer, Product Type, Shipment Status and Location.
    #  The other filter options must be disabled when filtering by the Shipment Number.
    #  I should be able to enter the shipment date range manually or select from the integrated component.
