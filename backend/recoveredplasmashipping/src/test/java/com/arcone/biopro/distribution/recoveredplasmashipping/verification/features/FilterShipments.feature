Feature: Filter Shipments

    Background:
        Given I have removed from the database all shipments which code contains with "DIS33400".

        Rule: I should be able to filter the shipment lists by specific criteria.
        Rule: The system should not enable the Apply options until at least one filter criteria is chosen.
        Rule: I should get shipments default sorting as: “status” descending and “shipmentDate” ascending.

        Scenario: Filter shipments through UI with multiple criteria
            Given The location "ABC1" is configured with prefix "PRE1", shipment code "DIS334002", shipment quantity "0", and prefix configuration "YES".
            And I request to create a new shipment with the values:
                | Field                           | Value      |
                | Customer                        | CUST001    |
                | Product Type                    | PLASMA     |
                | Carton Tare Weight              | 1000g      |
                | Shipment Date                   | <tomorrow> |
                | Transportation Reference Number | 111222333  |
            When I am at the List Shipment Page.
            Then The Filter Apply button should be "disabled".
            When I select the following filter criteria:
                | Customer        | BioLife Plasma Services |
                | Product Type    | Recovered Plasma        |
                | Location        | ABC1                    |
                | Shipment Status | OPEN                    |
            And I enter shipment date range from "2024-01-01" to "2024-03-31".
            Then The Filter Apply button should be "enabled".
            When I click the Filter Apply button.
            Then I should see filtered shipments matching the criteria.
            And The shipments should be sorted by status in descending order.
            And within same status, shipments should be sorted by shipment date in ascending order.
            And I should see "5" filter criteria applied.


        Rule: I should be able to search by
            Shipment Number, Customer, Product Type, Shipment Status,
            Shipment Date Range, Location and Transportation Reference Number as filter Options.
        Rule: I should be able to multi-select for Customer, Product Type, Shipment Status and Location.

            And I request to create a new shipment with the values:
                | Field                           | Value            |

                | Transportation Reference Number | 111222333        |
            When I requested the list of shipments filtering by "<Attribute>" as "<Value>".
            Then The list shipment response should contains "1" items.
            Examples:
                | Attribute                       | Value          |
                | shipmentDate                    | <CURRENT_DATE> |

                | Transportation Reference Number | 000            |


        Rule: I should be notified when no search results are found.

            Given I requested the list of shipments filtering by "<Attribute>" as "<Value>".
            When I receive the shipment list response.
            Then The list shipment response should contains "0" items.
            And I should receive a "WARN" message response "No results found".
