        Scenario Outline: Successfully verify products in carton by second scan
            Given I have an empty carton created with the Customer Code as "<Customer Code>" , Product Type as "<Product Type>", Carton Tare Weight as "<Carton Tare Weight>", Shipment Date as "<Shipment Date>", Transportation Reference Number as "<Transportation Reference Number>" and Location Code as "<Location Code>".
            And The Minimum Number of Units in Carton is configured as "<configured_min_products>" products for the customer code "<Customer Code>" and product type "<Product Type>".
            And I navigate to the Manage Carton Products page for the carton sequence number <Carton Sequence Number>.
            When I add an "acceptable" product with the unit number "<unit_number>", product code "<product_code>" and product type "<product_type>".
            Then The verify products option should be "enabled"
            And I choose to verify products.
            When I scan an "acceptable" product with the unit number "<unit_number>", product code "<product_code>" and product type "<product_type>".
            Then I should see the product in the verified list with unit number "<unit_number>" and product code "<product_code>".
            And The close carton option should be "enabled".
