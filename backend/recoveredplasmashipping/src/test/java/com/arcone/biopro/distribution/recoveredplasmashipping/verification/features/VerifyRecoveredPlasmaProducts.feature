        Rule: I should be able to perform a second scan of the unit number and product code.
        Rule: I should be able to confirm that a second verification of the products in the carton has been completed.
        Rule: I should be able to view shipping information.
        Rule: I should be able to view carton information.
        Rule: I should have an option to add more products in the carton when a product fails a validation.
        Rule: I should only be able to close a carton if the minimum numbers of products has been reached.
        Rule: The system should automatically update the status of the carton to closed once the carton is successfully closed.
        Rule: I should be able to only scan the unit number and product code.

        Scenario Outline: Successfully verify products in carton by second scan and close carton
            Given I have an empty carton created with the Customer Code as "<Customer Code>" , Product Type as "<Product Type>", Carton Tare Weight as "<Carton Tare Weight>", Shipment Date as "<Shipment Date>", Transportation Reference Number as "<Transportation Reference Number>" and Location Code as "<Location Code>".
            And The Minimum Number of Units in Carton is configured as "<configured_min_products>" products for the customer code "<Customer Code>" and product type "<Product Type>".
            And I navigate to the Manage Carton Products page for the carton sequence number <Carton Sequence Number>.
            When I add an "acceptable" product with the unit number "<unit_number>", product code "<product_code>" and product type "<product_type>".
            Then The verify products option should be "enabled"
            And I choose the Next option to start verify products process.
            When I scan to verify an "acceptable" product with the unit number "<unit_number>", product code "<product_code>" and product type "<product_type>".
            Then I "should" see the product in the verified list with unit number "<unit_number>" and product code "<product_code>".
            And The close carton option should be "enabled".
            When I choose to close the carton.
            Then I should be redirected to the Shipment Details page.
            And I should see a "SUCCESS" message: "Carton closed successfully".
            And I should see the list of cartons added to the shipment containing:
