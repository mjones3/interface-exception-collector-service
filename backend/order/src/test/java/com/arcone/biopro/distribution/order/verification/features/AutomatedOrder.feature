Feature: Validate order
    As a system, I want to validate the customer order
    so that I can save the order or decline the order based on the validation result.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID "114117922233598,114117922233598,114117922233511,114117922233512,114117922233513,114117922233514,114117922233515,114117922233516,114117922233517,114117922233518,114117922233519,114117922233520".

    Scenario: Creating a BioPro order from a valid order inbound request
        Given I have received an order inbound request with externalId "114117922233598" and content "order-inbound-scenario-1-happy-path.json".
        When The system process the order request.
        Then A biopro Order will be available in the Distribution local data store.
