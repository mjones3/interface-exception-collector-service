Feature: View order details

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "ORDER".

        Rule: I should be able to see the available inventory for each line item.
        Rule: I should be able to see the internal transfer order details.
        Rule: The system should create a BioPro internal transfer order when an internal transfer order is received through the third-party application.
        Rule: I should be able to see the internal transfer order details.
        Rule: I should be able to see the quarantine status of the internal transfer order.
        Rule: I should be able to see the Label status of the internal transfer order.
        Rule: I should be able to see the shipment type information for the orders.
        Rule: The available inventory information should not be available for internal transfer orders.
