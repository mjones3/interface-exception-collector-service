Feature: Modify Order

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXTDIS316".

         Rule: The modified order request must be rejected if the internal BioPro order is not in the 'Open' status.
        Rule: The modified order request must be rejected if the order doesn't exist.
        Rule: The modified order request must be rejected if the content of the request doesn't match the acceptable values configured in the system.
        Rule: The modified order request must be rejected for a backorder.
        Rule: The modified order date and time and the employee who modified the order must be displayed on the BioPro application.
        Rule: The modified order request details must be available in the BioPro application.
