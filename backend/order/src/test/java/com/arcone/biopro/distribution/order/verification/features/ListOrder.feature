Feature: List of all orders in Search Order
    As a Distribution Technician,
    I want to see the list of orders
    so that I am able to see the list of orders based on priority.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXT".
        And I have restored the default configuration for the order priority colors.

    Rule: I should be able to see the list of orders by priority and status where the user logged in.
    Rule: I should be able to view the following information if an order exists
        BioPro Order Number, External Order ID, Priority, Status, Ship to Customer Name, Create Date and Time (MM/DD/YYYY HR:MINS), Desired Ship Date.
    Rule: I should be able to see an option to view the details of an order.
    Rule: I should be able to see the priority column color coded.

            Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID "<External ID>".
            And I have a Biopro Order with externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
            And I am logged in the location "<LocationCode>".
            When I choose search orders.
            Then I should see the order details.
            And I should see the priority colored as "<Priority Color>"
            And I should see an option to see the order details.
