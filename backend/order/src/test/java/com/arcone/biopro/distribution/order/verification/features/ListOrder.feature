Feature: List of all orders in Search Order
    As a Distribution Technician,
    I want to see the list of orders
    so that I am able to see the list of orders based on priority.

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID "114117922233598,114117922233599,114117922233578,114117922233579,114117922233510".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXT_".

    Rule: I should be able to see the list of orders by priority and status where the user logged in.
        Rule: I should be able to view the following information if an order exists
        BioPro Order Number, External Order ID, Priority, Status, Ship to Customer Name, Create Date and Time (MM/DD/YYYY HR:MINS), Desired Ship Date.
    Rule: I should be able to see an option to view the details of an order.
        Rule: I should be able to see the priority column color coded.

        Scenario Outline: List Biopro Orders by priority, status and location
            Given I have a Biopro Order with externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
            And I am logged in the location "<LocationCode>".
            When I choose search orders.
            And I should see the order details.
            And I should see the priority colored as "<Priority Color>"
            And I should see an option to see the order details.

            Examples:
                | External ID     | LocationCode | Priority | Status | Priority Color |
                | 114117922233598 | 123456789    | STAT     | OPEN   | Red            |
                | 114117922233599 | 234567891    | ASAP     | OPEN   | Orange         |


    Rule: I should be able to configure the color options for the priority column.

            Given I have a Biopro Order with externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
            And I have setup the order priority "<Priority>" color configuration as "<Priority Color>".
            When I choose search orders.
            And I should see the order details.
            And I should see the priority colored as "<Priority Color>"

            When I choose search orders.
            Then I should not see the the biopro order in the list of orders.
