Feature: List of all orders in Search Order

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXT1141179".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXTDIS220".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXTDIS227".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXT20RECORDS".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXTDIS237".
        And I have restored the default configuration for the order priority colors.
        And I have removed from the database all the configurations for the location "987654321_DIS481".

    Rule: I should be able to see the list of orders by priority and status where the user logged in.
        Rule: I should be able to view the following information if an order exists
        BioPro Order Number, External Order ID, Priority, Status, Ship to Customer Name, Create Date and Time (MM/DD/YYYY HR:MINS), Desired Ship Date.
    Rule: I should be able to see an option to view the details of an order.
        Rule: I should be able to see the priority column color coded.
    Rule: I should be able to configure the color options for the priority column.

            Then I should not see the biopro order in the list of orders.
            And I should see a "Caution" message: "No Results Found".

            Examples:
                | External ID        | Order LocationCode | User LocationCode | Priority | Status |
