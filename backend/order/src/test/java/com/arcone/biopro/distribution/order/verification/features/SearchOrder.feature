Feature: Search Orders

    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXTSEARCH1".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "29402".


    Rule: I should be able to filter the order lists by specific criteria.
        Rule: I should be able to apply filter criteria.
    Rule: I should be able to search the order by BioPro order number or External Order ID.
        Rule: I should be prevented from selecting other filters when BioPro Order number or External ID is selected.
    Rule: I should be able to see the other filter options disabled when filtering by either the BioPro Order number or External Order ID.

        Scenario Outline: Search orders by Order Number
            Given I have a Biopro Order with externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<Order LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
            And I have another Biopro Order with the externalId equals to order number of the previous order.
            And I am logged in the location "<User LocationCode>".
            And I choose search orders.
            And I open the search orders filter panel.
            And "order number, create date from, create date to, desired shipment date from, desired shipment date to, order status, priority, ship to customer" fields are "enabled".
            And I search the order by "<Search Key>".
            And "create date from, create date to, desired shipment date from, desired shipment date to, order status, priority, ship to customer" fields are "disabled".
            When I choose "apply" option.
            Then I should see 2 orders in the search results.

            Examples:
                | External ID   | Order LocationCode | User LocationCode | Priority | Status    | Search Key |
                | EXTSEARCH1979 | 123456789          | 123456789         | STAT     | OPEN      | orderId    |
                | EXTSEARCH1984 | 123456789          | 123456789         | STAT     | OPEN      | orderId    |
                | EXTSEARCH1985 | 123456789          | 123456789         | STAT     | CANCELLED | orderId    |


    Rule: I should not be able to use a greater initial date when compared to final date field
        Rule: I should be able to filter the results for date fields from 2 years back.
    Rule: I should not be able to search more than 2 years range.

        Scenario Outline: Search for orders with wrong data range
            Given I have an order with external ID "EXTSEARCH1R20228001" and status "OPEN".
            When I search for orders by "createDate" from "<Create Date From>" to "<Create Date To>".
            Then I should receive a "BAD_REQUEST" error message response "<Error Message>".
            Examples:
                | Create Date From | Create Date To | Error Message                                      |
                | 2025-01-02       | 2025-01-01     | Initial date should not be greater than final date |
                | 2021-05-05       | 2024-05-01     | Date range exceeds two years                       |
                | 2021-05-05       | 2099-05-01     | Final date should not be greater than today        |


    Rule: I should be able to search completed orders by order number.

        Scenario Outline: Search completed order and the associated backorder
            Given I have an order with external ID "<External Id>" partially fulfilled with a shipment "<Shipment Status>".
            And I have Shipped "<Shipped Quantity>" products of each item line.
            And I have the back order configuration set to "true".
            And I request to complete the order.
            When I search for orders by "<Search Key>".
            Then I should receive the search results containing "<Expected Quantity>" orders.

            Examples:
                | Shipment Status | Search Key | Shipped Quantity | Expected Quantity | External Id        |
                | COMPLETED       | externalId | 2                | 2                 | EXTSEARCH1DIS29402 |
