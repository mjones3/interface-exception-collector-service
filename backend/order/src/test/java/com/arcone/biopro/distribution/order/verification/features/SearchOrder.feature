    Rule: I should be able to search the order by BioPro order number or External Oder ID. Display in the UI as BioPro Order #.
        Scenario Outline: Search orders by Order Number
            Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID "<External ID>".
            And I have a Biopro Order with externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<Order LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
            And I am logged in the location "<User LocationCode>".
            And I choose search orders.
            When I search the order by "<Order Key>".
            Then I should be redirected to the order details page.

            Examples:
                | External ID     | Order LocationCode | User LocationCode | Priority | Status | Order Key  |
