    Background:
        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "EXTSEARCH1,ORDERDIS".
        And I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID starting with "29402".
        And I have removed from the database all the configurations for the location "123456789_DIS481".


        Rule: I should be able to filter the order lists by specific criteria.
        Rule: I should be able to apply filter criteria.
        Rule: I should be able to search the order by BioPro order number or External Order ID.
        Rule: I should be prevented from selecting other filters when BioPro Order number or External ID is selected.
        Rule: I should be able to see the other filter options disabled when filtering by either the BioPro Order number or External Order ID.

        Scenario Outline: Search orders by Order Number
            Given I have a Biopro Order with externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<Order LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
            And I have an order item with product family "APHERESIS_PLATELETS_LEUKOREDUCED", blood type "AP", quantity 5, and order item comments "Comments".
            And I have another Biopro Order with the externalId equals to order number of the previous order.
            And I have an order item with product family "APHERESIS_PLATELETS_LEUKOREDUCED", blood type "ON", quantity 2, and order item comments "Comments 2".
            And I am logged in the location "<User LocationCode>".
            And I choose search orders.
            And I open the search orders filter panel.
            And "order number, create date from, create date to, desired shipment date from, desired shipment date to, order status, priority, shipment type" fields are "enabled".
            And "ship to customer, ship to location" fields are "disabled".
            And I search the order by "<Search Key>".
            And "create date from, create date to, desired shipment date from, desired shipment date to, order status, priority, ship to customer, ship to location, shipment type" fields are "disabled".
            When I choose "apply" option.
            Then I should see 2 orders in the search results.

            Examples:
                | External ID   | Order LocationCode | User LocationCode | Priority | Status    | Search Key |
                | EXTSEARCH1979 | 123456789          | 123456789         | STAT     | OPEN      | orderId    |

        Rule: I should be able to filter the results for date fields from 2 years back.
    Rule: I should not be able to search more than 2 years range.

            Then I should receive a "BAD_REQUEST" error message response "<Error Message>".
            Examples:
                | Create Date From | Create Date To | Error Message                                      |
                | 2025-01-02       | 2025-01-01     | Initial date should not be greater than final date |

            Then I should see a "Caution" message: "No Results Found".

            Examples:
                | External ID              | Order LocationCode | User LocationCode | Priority | Status | Search Key |
                | EXTSEARCH114117922233510 | 123456789          | 234567891         | STAT     | OPEN   | externalId |
                | EXTSEARCH114117922233510 | 123456789          | 123456788         | STAT     | OPEN   | 000111     |

    Rule: I should be able to filter the results for date fields from 2 years back.
        Rule: I should be able to enter the create date manually or select from the integrated component.
    Rule: I should not be able to search more than 2 years range.
        Rule: I should not be able to apply filters if any field validations fail.
    Rule: I should be able to implement the field-level validation and display an error message if the validations fail.

        Scenario: Check if the values informed for create date range don't exceed 2 years in the past
            Given I am logged in the location "123456789".
            And I choose search orders.
            And I open the search orders filter panel.
            When I enter a past date: "11/31/2018" for the field "create date from".
            Then I should see a validation message: "Date range exceeds two years".
            And "reset" option is "enabled".
            And "apply" option is "disabled".
