        Given I cleaned up from the database the orders with external ID "1979,1984,2018,DIS1141179,114117922233510".


    Rule: I should be able to filter the order lists by specific criteria.
        Rule: I should be able to apply filter criteria.
    Rule: I should be able to search the order by BioPro order number or External Order ID.
        Rule: I should be prevented from selecting other filters when BioPro Order number or External ID is selected.
    Rule: I should be able to see the other filter options disabled when filtering by either the BioPro Order number or External Order ID.

        Scenario Outline: Search orders by Order Number
            Given I have a Biopro Order with id "<Order Number>", externalId "<External ID>", Location Code "<Order LocationCode>", Priority "<Priority>" and Status "<Status>".
