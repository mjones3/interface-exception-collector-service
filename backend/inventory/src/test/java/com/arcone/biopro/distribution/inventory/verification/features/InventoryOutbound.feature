Feature: Inventory Outbound Interface
    Rule: As an inventory service I want to create an inventory update event every time an inventory is created/updated
        Scenario Outline: Produce an inventory updated event every time an inventory is create/update
            Given I have the following inventories:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code   | Location   |
                | <Unit Number> | <Product Code> | <Location> |

            When I received a "<Event>" event for the following products:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code         | Is licensed   | Reason   | Reason Id   | Shipment type   | Device Storage   | Storage Location   | Location   |
                | <Unit Number> | <Final Product Code> | <Is licensed> | <Reason> | <Reason Id> | <Shipment type> | <Device Storage> | <Storage Location> | <Location> |

            Then the inventory updated event should be produced with the "<Update Type>" value in the payload for the following units:
                | Unit Number   | Final Product Code   |
                | <Unit Number> | <Final Product Code> |

            Examples:
                | Event              | Unit Number   | Product Code | Final Product Code | Is licensed | Shipment type | Reason            | Reason Id | Device Storage | Storage Location        | Location   | Update Type        |
