Feature: Label Invalidated Event
    Rule: As an inventory service I want to listen to label invalidated event so that I can update the inventory removing label and licensing flag
        Scenario Outline: Update the inventory information about label adn license flags after receiving a Label Invalidated Event.
            Given I have the following inventories:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code            | Is licensed | Is Labeled |
                | <Unit Number> | <Product Code Existing> | YES         | YES        |

            When I received a Label Invalidated event for the following products:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code            |
                | <Unit Number> | <Product Code Received> |

            Then the inventory statuses should be updated as follows:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code            | Status    | Is Labeled | Is licensed |
                | <Unit Number> | <Product Code Existing> | AVAILABLE | false      | false       |

            Examples:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code Received | Product Code Existing |
