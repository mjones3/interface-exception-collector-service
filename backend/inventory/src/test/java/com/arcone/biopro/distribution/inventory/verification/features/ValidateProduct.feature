        When I request "<Unit Number>" with "<Product Code>" in the "<Location>"
        Then I receive for "<Unit Number>" with "<Product Code>" and temperature category "<Temperature Category>" in the "<Location>" a "<RESPONSE ERROR>" message with "<ACTION>" action and "<REASON>" reason and "<MESSAGE>" message and details "<DETAILS>"

        Examples:
            | Unit Number   | Product Code | Temperature Category | Location   | RESPONSE ERROR                  | ACTION             | REASON          | MESSAGE                                                                                                              | DETAILS                                                                             |
