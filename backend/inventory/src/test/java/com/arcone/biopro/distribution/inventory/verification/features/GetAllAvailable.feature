    Scenario Outline: Get all available inventories
        Given I have "2" of the "PLASMA_TRANSFUSABLE" of the blood type "OP" in the "LOCATION_1" will expire in "2" days
        And I have "3" of the "PLASMA_TRANSFUSABLE" of the blood type "OP" in the "LOCATION_2" will expire in "2" days

        Then I receive "<Quantity>" of total products and "<Short Date Quantity>" of short date

        Examples:
