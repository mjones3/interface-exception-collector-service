Feature: Product Created event
    Rule: As an inventory service I want to listen to product created event so that I can create the inventory, convert its parent if any, and manage its statuses
        Scenario Outline: Create the inventory as AVAILABLE and UNLABELED and convert its parent after receiving a Product Created event.
            Given I have the following inventories:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code          | Status    |
                | <Unit Number> | <Parent Product Code> | AVAILABLE |

            When I received a Product Created event for the following products:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code   | Parent Product Code   | Has Expiration Date   | Collection Location | Collection TimeZone |
                | <Unit Number> | <Product Code> | <Parent Product Code> | <Has Expiration Date> | <Collection Location> | <Collection TimeZone> |

            Then the parent inventory statuses should be updated as follows:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code          | Status    |
                | <Unit Number> | <Parent Product Code> | CONVERTED |

            And the inventory statuses should be updated as follows:
                | Unit Number   | Product Code   | Status    | Is Labeled | Temperature Category   |
                | <Unit Number> | <Product Code> | AVAILABLE | false      | <Temperature Category> |

            Examples:
                | Unit Number   | Parent Product Code | Product Code | Has Expiration Date | Temperature Category | Collection Location | Collection TimeZone |
