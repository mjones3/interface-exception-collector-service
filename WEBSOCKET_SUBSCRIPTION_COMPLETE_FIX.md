# WebSocket GraphQL Subscription Complete Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing @SubscriptionMapping Annotations**: The subscription methods were missing proper mapping annotations
2. **WebSocket Transport Configuration**: May need additional configuration
3. **Event Publishing Chain**: Enhanced logging shows the complete flow
4. **Schema Registration**: Subscription type exists in schema but wasn't being mapped to resolvers

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Subscription Resolver Annotations

**File**: `interface-exception-collector/src/main/java/com/arcone/biopro/exception/collector/api/graphql/resolver/ExceptionSubscriptionResolver.java`

```java
@SubscriptionMapping("exceptionUpdated")  // Added explicit mapping name
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('VIEWER')")
public Flux<ExceptionUpdateEvent> exceptionUpdated(
    @Argument("filters") SubscriptionFilters filters,
    Authentication authentication) {

@SubscriptionMapping("retryStatusUpdated")  // Added explicit mapping name  
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('OPERATIONS')")
public Flux<RetryStatusEvent> retryStatusUpdated(
    @Argument("transactionId") String transactionId,
    Authentication authentication) {
```

### 2. Enhanced Event Publishing Logging

**File**: `interface-exception-collector/src/main/java/com/arcone/biopro/exception/collector/api/graphql/service/ExceptionEventPublisher.java`

Added comprehensive debug logging:
- Exception details logging
- Method call tracing
- Success/failure tracking
- WebSocket broadcast confirmation

**File**: `interface-exception-collector/src/main/java/com/arcone/biopro/exception/collector/api/graphql/resolver/ExceptionSubscriptionResolver.java`

Added debug logging:
- Active subscription count
- Sink subscriber count
- Emit result status
- Error tracking

### 3. WebSocket Transport Configuration

**File**: `interface-exception-collector/src/main/java/com/arcone/biopro/exception/collector/api/graphql/config/GraphQLWebSocketTransportConfig.java`

Provides:
- WebSocket handler at `/graphql`
- JWT authentication support
- Session management
- Message broadcasting capability

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Scripts

Created multiple PowerShell scripts for debugging:

- `debug-event-publishing-flow-fixed.ps1`: End-to-end flow testing
- `test-websocket-only.ps1`: WebSocket connection testing
- `check-subscription-state.ps1`: Schema and state verification
- `test-websocket-subscription-live.ps1`: Live event monitoring

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Restart the Application
```bash
# Restart your Spring Boot application to load the new annotations
```

### Step 2: Verify Schema Registration
```powershell
powershell -File check-subscription-state.ps1
```

**Expected Output:**
- "Subscription schema found" with `exceptionUpdated` and `retryStatusUpdated` fields
- "Subscription type is properly registered"

### Step 3: Test WebSocket Connection
```powershell
# If WebSocket assemblies are available
powershell -File test-websocket-only.ps1

# Alternative: Use browser-based testing
# Open graphql-subscription-test.html in browser
```

### Step 4: Monitor Event Publishing
```powershell
# In one terminal - start listening
powershell -File test-websocket-subscription-live.ps1

# In another terminal - trigger events
powershell -File debug-event-publishing-flow-fixed.ps1
```

## Application Log Messages to Look For

### Startup Messages
```
- Bean creation: ExceptionEventPublisher
- Bean creation: ExceptionSubscriptionResolver  
- WebSocket configuration loaded
- GraphQL subscription mappings registered
```

### Runtime Messages (Event Creation)
```
🔔 Publishing GraphQL exception created event for transaction: [ID]
🔍 DEBUG: Exception details - ID: [ID], Status: NEW, Severity: HIGH
📡 Calling subscriptionResolver.publishExceptionUpdate() for transaction: [ID]
✅ Successfully called subscriptionResolver.publishExceptionUpdate() for transaction: [ID]
📡 Broadcasted exception created event via WebSocket to [N] sessions
```

### Runtime Messages (Event Publishing)
```
📡 Received exception update event for publishing: CREATED - transaction: [ID]
🔍 DEBUG: Active subscriptions count: [N]
🔍 DEBUG: Sink has subscribers: [N]
✅ Successfully published exception update event for transaction: [ID] to [N] subscribers
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Schema Still Not Registered
1. Check Spring Boot logs for component scanning errors
2. Verify `@Controller` annotation on ExceptionSubscriptionResolver
3. Ensure GraphQL auto-configuration is enabled

### If WebSocket Connection Fails
1. Check if port 8080 WebSocket endpoint is accessible
2. Verify JWT token is valid and has required roles
3. Check firewall/proxy settings

### If Events Not Published
1. Look for "Sink has subscribers: 0" - means no active subscriptions
2. Check for dependency injection errors with ExceptionEventPublisher
3. Verify ExceptionProcessingService is calling the event publisher

### If Events Published But Not Received
1. Check WebSocket transport configuration
2. Verify subscription filters aren't blocking events
3. Check authentication/authorization on subscription

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Schema Query**: Should show Subscription type with exceptionUpdated field
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Should connect and acknowledge successfully  
3. **Event Creation**: Should trigger publishing logs in application
4. **Event Reception**: WebSocket clients should receive real-time events
5. **Subscription Count**: Should show > 0 active subscribers when clients connect

## Next Steps

1. Restart application with fixes
2. Run verification scripts
3. Check application logs for expected messages
4. Test with real WebSocket client (browser or Node.js)
5. Verify end-to-end flow with event creation and reception

The key fix was adding the explicit `@SubscriptionMapping` annotations with field names, which registers the subscription methods with the GraphQL schema properly.
